8/19/2017,5,I made this with a very good piece of swordfish and it was delicious!
8/9/2017,5,Loved it!  Used apple cider vinegar instead of wine.
7/29/2017,5,Delicious and very easy to make...a real crowd pleaser.
6/23/2017,5,I have made this countless times and obviously love it. I switched to Halibut because of heavy metal concerns with swordfish. It is just as good. The halibut holds up well to grilling. I'd love...
5/12/2017,5,This turned out really good. I followed the recipe but added more garlic to the marinade. I love garlic. I ended up cooking it in a cast iron skillet since it rained today. I know it will be ev...
5/10/2017,5,WOW! so good!  We really are tarter sauce people.  Sometimes I make fish just so I can have tarter sauce but this is something else.  By the time we were finished the only thing left on our pla...
3/30/2017,5,Excellent recipe! Followed all ingredients but added just slightly to each. Came out very tasty! Glad I found this and will use again!
2/12/2017,5,This was my first time making swordfish.  This recipe was so perfect!  Easy tender and delicious.  Made it just as recommended...Thank you !
1/31/2017,5,No changes - it was great!
1/5/2017,5,Definitely a keeper.
1/1/2017,5,This was to die for delicious!  I ended up marinating it for about 30 hours because I got sidetracked that day.  The only ingredient change I made was double the garlic just because the hubs was...
12/30/2016,5,So good and so easy.
10/18/2016,5,Worth the effort. Delicious.
10/1/2016,5,This marinade is awesome. Made it as written except used cod (swordfish not available) and even my 15 yr old daughter liked it. Will use again.
9/24/2016,5,Definitely use a garlic press rather than mincing gives more garlic flavor. Recipe flavors blended perfectly w pressed garlic and a cheap pinot grigio.
8/3/2016,5,This marinade was fantastic!!
7/18/2016,5,SO glad I tried this recipe! I will never make swordfish any other way ever again!!! The marinade is perfect for a summer grill-out. We paired with fresh roasted asparagus and long grain wild ri...
6/19/2016,5,"WOW!  Very good. Even my husband who doesn't care for fish liked it...A LOT!

Next time I am going to marinate all day in the fridge. Also I substituted Mahi Mahi for the the swordfish...bet i..."
3/30/2016,5,good!! I made it pretty much exactly I just marinaded it for 3 hours without the lemon juice because that would cook the steaks. I added the lemon juice a few minutes prior to broiling the fish...
1/25/2016,5,Soo good! Like another reviewer I was also concerned it might turn out on the bland side since all of the ingredients were pretty basic (and the fact that I had them all on hand without having ...
10/11/2015,5,I am pleasantly surprised at the simplicity of this recipe.  It's just two of us and short of adding some cayenne at the mans request it was just right.  Not too sweet not too anything!  So ma...
9/8/2015,5,This was very good and very easy. I used Goya Adobo seasoning for the poultry seasoning and I minced up the garlic cloves with a knife.  There was no specification.  I ended up leaving the two v...
9/4/2015,5,I've made this several times and my wife and I love it! The only change I make is to use low sodium soy sauce and a bit more black pepper!
8/1/2015,5,My second time with this dish and it was even better than the first. The trick seems to be not to overcook it so the pertinent variable is how thick the steaks are and you go from there as far...
6/27/2015,5,Best ever swordfish came out great!!
6/25/2015,5,This was wonderful!  I made it according to the directions.  My husband who is hard to please said this one is a keeper!!!
6/21/2015,5,This was Perfect.  (Well my version anyway).   I had one steak just for me.   Figured about 1/3-1/2 of the ingredients. I used red wine vinegar instead of white wine.   I used a generous percent...
2/2/2015,5,This marinade was just incredible. We soaked two large swordfish steaks in the exact recipe even though it was designed for 4. We flipped halfway through and then cooked on stove top with an Ike...
1/18/2015,5,This marinade is the reason we have swordfish several times a month. Picky husband loves it too.  So easy to make extremely flavorful.  One of our favorites!
11/20/2014,5,I didn't expect it to be this good...loved it. Marinade also helped keep the fish juicy - my experience with swordfish previously was that it was too dry.
10/24/2014,5,Absolutely delicious. This was my first time eating/cooking swordfish and it was just so delicious!!
10/20/2014,5,Love this dish for swordfish.
8/20/2014,5,Didn't turn it frequently b/c i just don't see the point (only turned it over once) didn't add salt because of the soy sauce.  Comes out awesome every time.
8/6/2014,5,Wonderful recipe made it just as the recipe called for and I will make this again and again.  I marinated in a bag in the fridge.
8/2/2014,5,Excellent Flavor!
7/1/2014,5,We love this marinade. It is very flavorful without overpowering the fish. This is the only way we make swordfish now!
6/29/2014,5,Loved it!  Great taste but not over bearing.  I used a dry white wine (not a fan of sweet wine) and poured myself a glass to drink with it.
6/22/2014,5,This was the best swordfish I've ever had. We had two fresh nice size fillets and made the recipe exactly as written. Will be making again soon!
5/26/2014,5,FANTASTIC!!!!!!
4/14/2014,5,Delicious.  Did not have lemon substituted mix of orange and lime juice.  Steaks were thick 6 minutes were not enough.   Made a citrus risotto with remaining juice and zest from the orange and...
4/10/2014,5,Really easy and delicious every time! I marinate it in a ziplock bag so I don't have to turn it. Also I sometimes substitute 1 tbs. olive oil for 1 tbs. sesame oil.

1/27/2014,5,Delicious! I'll be using this recipe regularly. My whole family loved it!

11/8/2013,5,Fantastic! I've made this a few times and our whole family loves it. Thank you!
6/22/2013,5,We used this marinade the first time we made swordfish and we haven't looked for any others!  It's very good very easy.  We didn't have the white wine so we just use apple cider vinegar.  Also...

4/21/2013,5,Our grilled swordfish using this marinade was AWESOME!! I used the grated ginger and sesame oil in the mix as suggested by other reviewers. Both The Hub and I thought it tasted just like a melt ...

10/21/2012,5,Good recipe for swordfish.  It lets you taste the swordfish steak instead of masking it with a heavy sauce.
9/11/2012,5,We were pleasantly surprised by this! I was worried about all the poultry seasoning but it really added a nice flavor! I combined a bit of sour cream with minced onion horseradish and dijon to ...
8/25/2012,5,Excellent!  I made this exactly as the recipe stated but I marinated for 8 hours.  Nice and juicy with lots of flavor.  My kids loved it definitely will make again.
8/25/2012,5,I admit that I did cook this to perfection....5 minutes on one side and then 4:30 on the other but the marinade was awesome too.  Will definitely make again.
7/15/2012,5,I found this to be brain dead easy.  I did add one modification. After the steaks were in the marinade I grated fresh ginger over the steaks.  Everyone was blown away.  FYI you can buy a ginger ...
7/2/2012,5,These were fantastic!  And really really easy.  Because of our hectic schedule I had to let them sit for 2 1/2 hours in the marinade but it wasn't too strong of a taste.  My kids loved it and...
6/19/2012,5,Excellent marinade.  I didn't have any white wine on hand so I used cooking sherry and it still turned out great.  next time I will try it with the white wine.

5/12/2012,5,I tried this recipe although I had my doubts about it.  I couldn't imagine a swordfish recipe that included poultry seasoning.  However the flavors blended well and the swordfish turned out to ...
4/24/2012,5,This marinade was wonderful. We bought fresh swordfish from the fish market. It was a big hit. My daughter wants the recipe..Thank you!!
3/27/2012,5,I cook swordfish regularly and this is the best recipe I have ever used for swordfish. I cooked it last night and gave some to my sister in law and she also said it was the best. The only thing ...
3/25/2012,5,Excellent marinade however agree with other reviewers that swordfish needs to be marinated 6-8 hours. I will also used a little more soy sauce next time.
3/24/2012,5,"I live in the middle of nowhere and swordfish was still cheaper than a decent cut of steak.

You've probably got all the ingredients already.  Take a few minutes to mix up the marinade and throw..."
3/3/2012,5,Ever since the first time I used this marinade for my oven baked fish I've been using it for other things like chicken shrimp and even beef. Amazing.
2/2/2012,5,OH MY HEAVENS!!! This was PHENOMENAL!!!!! I wish I could give this 10 stars.  Even my son who said I don't do fish loved this.  Followed the recipe to a T and it was perfect.  It did take a lo...

10/16/2011,5,Outstanding flavors.  Swordfish ended up juicy.  Kids and husband loved it as did daughter's 12 y.o. friend who doesn't like fish but tried it and asked for more.  Didn't change a thing in the...

9/10/2010,5,perfect. i needed a quick marinate (an hour as not in 8 hours) and luved it.  I am in RI and get the best swordfish and this marinate did not abuse the fresh swordish.

7/21/2010,5,Best swordfish I ever had used chicken rub instead of poultry seasoing.  Marinated it in a plastic bag. Will try marinate with chicken.

1/24/2010,5,Very nice.  Didn't have time to marinate for full 8 hours but I'll make sure I do next time.  Had friends over who love fish and they were impressed.
12/3/2009,5,Simple easy to prepare and DELICIOUS! I made it with Ono instead of swordfish. - worked out great!
11/16/2009,5,We love this so much we haven't used a different recipe. Just make sure you don't overcook the steaks--on my Weber set on high two minutes per side does it.

5/4/2003,5,I give this 5 stars for my boyfriend although I found the fish a bit rubbery but I usually eat salmon. He loved it though and said he definitely wants me to cook it again. Thanks Mike!
5/22/2017,4,Very good recipe. I added 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika for some heat and substituted a fish rub spice in place of poultry seasoning. Grilled to 145 F and I think I could have gone 5-10 F lower

7/7/2014,4,Sauce had great flavor but didn't make it's way into the meat.  Next time we will either cut the fish into kabobs or make cross-hatch marks on the outside of the fish to get more flavor!
1/29/2014,4,The flavors were good but a little too tangy.. it needed a little sweetness. Maybe more herbs. In any case what helped the marinade soak in was to poke the fish all the way through with a fork. ...

3/5/2011,4,Very good marinade. I don't really like fish and I even liked it. My husband who loves fish loved it!
10/18/2010,4,This was a great recipe. I had all the ingredients at hand. This was the first time I had swordfish. I will be making this dish again.
9/26/2010,4,Very good.  Agree with one of the other reviews that the longer you can marinade it the tastier it is.  I thought the poultry seasoning sounded out of place when I first read the recipe but I ...
8/29/2010,4,This recipe is great however it is good to know that for 6 minutes on both sides the steaks have to be 1 inch thick- Mine were 1/2 inch thick and I grilled them 3 minutes on each side they wer...
8/24/2009,4,This was good DH liked it. marinated for about 2 hrs in fridge. Would be good on any white fish. Would probably make again.
3/6/2009,4,I didn't have any white wine on hand so I substituted with cider vinegar...I know not really close in flavor but it didn't come out too bad.  It is a light marinade with good flavors.  I want t...
10/15/2008,4,I've made this a few times now and it's a keeper!  everyone loves it so easy all ingredients on hand.  One suggestion to  all...I hate opening a new bottle of white wine for a little bit neede...
7/20/2008,4,Yum! This is the first time I've had swordfish so I don't know if it's the fish or the recipe but this was delicious. Now I had to change a couple things but I don't think it mattered. I didn't...
4/26/2008,4,Very Good.
9/11/2007,4,We made this tonight excellent! I did omit the oil as I'm trying to be heart healthy and I  only marinated for 45 minutes. Next time I will let it sit for 2 hours is our steaks are that thick ...
8/12/2007,4,I made this marinade and used Shark Steaks instead.  It turned out very nice!
7/25/2007,4,This was very good -- not an overpowering marinade but tasty and I imagine it would be good on salmon or other fish as well. However I found I wanted a little something else though...Maybe nex...
4/30/2007,4,Very easy and delicious.  I live in NYC - no grill so I used the broiler.  Cooked 5 min on each side on high. Worked perfectly. It's a keeper.
7/25/2006,4,A great marinate! But my husband and I both agreed it need a little herbed butter for the finish.
11/2/2005,4,A little too lemony for me and I used 1 whole Fresh Lemon which could have been the problem. Other than that it was amazing!
5/16/2005,4,This was good.  I decided to let the fish marinate a little bit longer than the recipe called for....and I wish that it had a little bit more flavor than it did.  Other than that it turned out v...
12/12/2004,4,My husband loved this.  I thought it was ok. Thought the poultry seasoning was a little to much would cut back on that next time.  Don't have a grill so I baked it at 400 for 20 minutes.
6/18/2004,4,This was a really nice basic marinade for swordfish.  I would make this again - grilling the fish is must.  I marinated the fish overnight and the flavor permeated the whole steak.  Very good!
6/26/2003,4,The flavors on this swordfish did not really come through even after soaking in the ingredients.  I think there might have been too many ingredients competing to flavor the fish and ended up not...
12/8/2016,3,the marinade was a little bit overpowering
7/1/2016,3,I followed the directions as written but listened to other reviewers' suggestions and marinated the swordfish for about 7 hours. We were just unimpressed with the flavor. It seemed a little blan...
6/26/2008,3,I'm rating this a 3 but I really wanted it to be a 5...I had made the Swordfish with Rosemary on this site before and was so impressed by it that I thought since this was so similar it would be ...
4/14/2008,3,overpowered the fish
10/23/2006,3,Good but I think I will follow another reviewer's idea of cutting the fish into kabobs.  The marinade did not fully infuse the steaks even after 8 hours.
2/12/2006,3,Okay...I've never had luck with swordfish so maybe it's just me...not sure where I went wrong.
2/25/2005,3,I thought this was just okay.  I do  not think my kids enjoyed since neither one of them finished their plates but in fairness my husband really liked.  I am  not sure if I would make again.
4/29/2012,2,I thought it was pretty bland.
9/8/2007,2,I marinated this fish for 8 hours I don't know maybe that was too long?  It was not good.  Sorry will not make this again.  I think I will stick with  swordfish with mango salsa.
10/9/2014,1,I did not care for this.  The poultry seasoning and garlic overwhelmed the swordfish.  Zero stars.
5/12/2013,1,Did not like the taste of the fish at all.  I'd rather use salt and pepper with lemon juice on the side.
11/26/2017,5,It was amazing. I took the other suggestions and only used 1 cup of sugar. It was perfect.
11/11/2017,5,Let me start by saying I've NEVER liked eggnog. But last year for Xmas I wanted to make something different with some booze in it. Found this recipe and OH. MY. GOD. This was so good. Made a b...
10/28/2017,5,Instead of light cream I used 2 cups heavy cream + 2 cups half & half. For the rum Captain Morgan's spiced. I used all 12 yolks and didn't have any problems with milk curdling or eggs cooking. ...
10/3/2017,5,Absolutely delicious! I never want to buy storebought eggnog anymore.
2/10/2017,5,I'm so greatful you submitted this recipe.   I make it for my 102 yr old mother all the time now.   She just loves it!   Thank you Natalie
1/14/2017,5,good stuff. made a half batch as a test and it is gone already.  :)  we did not strain it for the cloves because we thought we would just find them on our own and we did no trouble but i wonde...
1/12/2017,5,Made it without the rum and it was fabulous.
1/10/2017,5,We made it without the rum.  It  was very thick and delicious.
12/31/2016,5,This is THE best eggnog. I did not add the rum. It tastes fantastic all on its own. If I  want rum I will add one oz to a full glass of eggnog and top it with more nutmeg.
12/31/2016,5,Without a doubt the BEST eggnog I've ever made or tasted.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Creamy and fresh and just delicious.  My family loved this.  I will be making this every year!  Thank y...
12/29/2016,5,I've made this eggnog every year since first trying it in 2012. I made it exactly per the recipe the first year but my sister and I agreed that one less clove would taste better as it was slig...
12/29/2016,5,Love this recipe. You don't need to place in the fridge overnight neither do you have to add cream or rum
12/28/2016,5,Alcohol was strong at first for me but I'm drinking it on day 5 and it tastes much better aged. Overall really good recipe the ingredients come together perfectly
12/28/2016,5,Turned out awesome. I reduced the recipe to 4 servings because it was only for a couple people and I used Malibu coconut rum instead of light rum. Absolutely delicious and a very easy recipe. ...

12/23/2016,5,To keep things flowing I used my egg beaters to beat the yolks. Then I added the sugar. Beat on low then with a ladle I poured the milk mixture into the bowl down the sides of the bowl into the ...
12/23/2016,5,It came out AWESOME!  Cant get Eggnog in Europe or Russia so I had to make my own.
12/23/2016,5,I'm not a fan of eggnog and I LOVED this. I had to make this for only 3 servings rather than 12 but I am so happy I made this.
12/21/2016,5,Made this to be used in another recipe but it tastes so good I decided to save some for myself! I had 6 yolks left over from making meringues so I used those and 3 whole eggs instead of the fu...
12/20/2016,5,Absolutely delicious. Classic.  Easy and well worth the cooking and cooling time.
12/19/2016,5,Very good eggnog.   I did cut the sugar by %25 and next time will cut the cinnamon a little bit too.  This is a great eggnog for the holidays.
12/18/2016,5,5 stars with my changes!!! I used 1 vanilla bean 2 cinnamon sticks and 3 cloves to simmer in the milk.  then I used half  heavy cream and half half n half for the cream part and I used 1 cup of...
12/17/2016,5,"I'll make this again! It was perfect--just enough spice and rum and a light egg flavour. Like the one I loved best--made by my mom and g'mom many years ago.

11/23/2016,5,I have made this several times over the past two years. Now I have never really liked eggnog and made it originally for a Thanksgiving party. The host was a big fan of eggnog but her husband l...
11/23/2016,5,Delicious! Only changes I made were using heavy cream and whole milk because I didn't have light cream and I only used 1 cup of Captain Morgan spiced rum per batch.  Turned out amazing.  I will ...
11/21/2016,5,"Made it with fresh Goats Milk and fresh eggs.   I used 8 cups of raw fresh Goats Milk instead of the milk and cream called for.

Will definitely make again."
11/20/2016,5,Really is amazing. Perfect and wouldn't change a thing.
11/17/2016,5,"I've been making this eggnog for the holidays for the past 5 years and it's always appreciated.

2/17/2016,5,Can the recipe not use rum I'm under age.
1/30/2016,5,I would make it again but I have a question.  After I whipped the egg yolks and added the milk mixture everything was fine.  However once I placed it in a saucepan to simmer the eggs got cooked....
1/19/2016,5,"I made this for Christmas the past two years and both times it turned out great.

12/23/2015,5,This was my first time making eggnog and it turned out delicious! I followed the recipe exactly as written but only added half the amount of rum and it was perfect.
12/23/2015,5,I make this every year. It is the best eggnog ever. None of my family will drink store-bought eggnog any more! I've had friends and relatives offer to pay me to make gallons of this for their ho...

I prefer the Eggnog I recipe on this website a little more though."

1/25/2013,5,This is the best eggnog recipe of all time.   I leave out the rum because I make it as a dessert.  Many of the negative reviews are referencing the rum.  I think the ratio is wrong in the recipe...
1/10/2013,5,Soooooo good - used rum extract instead to get the rum taste without the alcohol content
1/7/2013,5,Loved this! Very thick! I actually had to thin it with some milk before serving.
12/30/2012,5,We live in England and can't get eggnog-- we love this!  I do leave out the rum and that leaves ] a bit more thick. Also I am able to make eggnog latte or add it to my coffee.

12/28/2012,5,My husband and I decided to make home made eggnog and this is the recipe we chose. We cut the rum in half and also set 2 cups aside for the 10 yr old!  It is a great recipe we all agreed on 5 s...
12/26/2012,5,After our store ran out of eggnog I made this using 2% milk and heavy cream. If I can find it next time I will use light cream for health reasons but this was very rich creamy and delicious!...
12/25/2012,5,This was sensational! Having never had eggnog before I wasn't sure what to expect but we all devoured it in no time. We made a non-alcoholic version for the kids and then added a shot each of Ba...

5/16/2012,5,Great eggnog it made the holidays feel so cozy.

10/21/2011,5,This would've been excellent had I not scorched it! I added heavy whipping cream to it which made it nice and creamy...unfortunately I scorched it while handleling my little baby.

1/30/2008,5,Sooooo good! I made it exactly like you said and had no problems with curdling. It went down a treat on christmas eve - even in sunny Australia!!
1/23/2008,5,Great on a cold winter night when you are sitting around putting together puzzles and eating cookies!!  Better than store bought.
1/22/2008,5,I've made this recipe quite a few times and I've tampered with it...but seriously there's no need!  I LOVE it just as is.  Awesomely amazingly good eggnog!
1/21/2008,5,Creamy!!!  We loved it.  I make Eggnog every year even though its not a traditional Xmas drink here in Australia.  This was the best one I've tried so far and I'll be sticking with this recipe ...
1/15/2008,5,I hate eggnog but this was pretty good! I took it to a family Christmas dinner and everyone was raving about it. My MIL wouldn't let me bring the leftovers home! Hubby bought a carton from the ...
1/10/2008,5,This was my first time making eggnog and this recipe was perfect. Everyone enjoyed it and the rum can easily be added as needed. We used 2 cups instead of 2 and 1/2 but really you can be very fl...
1/9/2008,5,Excellent eggnog!  I left out the rum because I wanted to share with my children but I did add a touch of rum extract.
1/9/2008,5,This was my first attempt at home made egg nog and the results were fabulous!  Before I added the rum I set aside 1 quart of the mixture for a virgin eggnog as we were having lots of children f...
1/9/2008,5,I used this recipe over the holidays because my family loves eggnog. It has a smooth creamy texture and everyone loved it.
1/9/2008,5,Wonderful holiday treat!  I whipped up the egg yolks and sugar in my stand mixer and kept the mixer going as I added the milk.  Came out great.
1/8/2008,5,Very good nog! I went easy on the liquor but it was still too strong for my taste. My friends raved about how great is tasted. It was most people's first having homemade eggnog.
1/7/2008,5,Always good stuff.  I have found that a nice spiced rum works perfectly with the spices.  I use Captain Morgan but I am sure anything would work.
1/5/2008,5,This is Amazingly Good!  I added a bit more milk at the end when I added the rum.  I also whipped fresh whipped cream and sprinkled some nutmeg on top.  A definite party pleaser!
1/3/2008,5,This egg nogg did take a bit of time to make but in the end it was worth it. I loved the taste and everyone else in my family loved it too!! Looks like I found a holiday staple for my family. T...
1/2/2008,5,This was my first attempt at making eggnog.  It was easy and it really does taste amazingly good!  A new holiday tradition!
12/31/2007,5,Great recipe! We compared it side-by-side with the store bought kind and hands down this recipe is better! I only used 2 cups of rum and found it a bit strong still so next time I will start sma...
12/28/2007,5,I don't give many five star reviews but this deserves it. The BEST eggnog ever! I've made it with rum and rum extract (when we had non-drinkers over) and both were great. I also used this to mak...
12/28/2007,5,Delicious even with less rum. The flavors blend very well together; all our guests loved it.
12/27/2007,5,This was a hit at our house.  Thick and rich - I'd encourage people to try it with rum in it - added 'to your taste'.  It makes it more adult.  Could modify by adding more milk for thinner nog. ...
12/26/2007,5,Spicy and oh SO yummy!  Better than store bought. Don't change a thing.  Anyone who says it was not as thick as it should have been must not have cooked it enough.  I did it in a big metal bowl ...
12/26/2007,5,Awesome!  Wouldn't change a thing.  It was the best egg nog we've ever had.  I love that the eggs are cooked.
12/25/2007,5,Those years of experimentation really paid off. I'd never made homemade eggnog before because most recipes I found use raw eggs so when I found this one I thought I'd give it a try. It was wort...
12/24/2007,5,My husband won't buy the store stuff anymore he says he is ruined forever because this is so good.  We don't use rum or rum extract and still delicious.
12/24/2007,5,My Dad and I had an eggnog cook-off. It was both of our first times making eggnog. I used this recipe and Dad used Alton Brown's (food network). Mine won hands-down! I love this recipe and will ...
12/24/2007,5,This was great and SIMPLE!  Even those with little or no cooking skills could make this.  I only had 2 cups of white rum so topped it off with spiced rum and it was wonderful.  I have made the s...
12/24/2007,5,This recipe was definately amazing. I had to make two batches because it was loved so much.
12/24/2007,5,This was really good I only added 2 cups of the rum and found it very strong so added some more milk. Also made it without rum and and son loves it.
12/24/2007,5,This nog is da' bomb. I omitted the cloves for no better reason as I was feeling broke with the holidays and all. Those little things are pricey. I suppose I would have had more money if I had...
12/24/2007,5,Never made eggnog before in my life. I searched for the best (and easiest) cooked egg nog recipe with alcohol and this one was the winner! Super easy to make and delicious! I added 1 1/2 c. rum ...
12/24/2007,5,"This recipe is amazing. I didn't mess up the cooking so was brilliant. Was a little sweet so may use a third less sugar next time (I'm making it again tonight) but all in all was amazing.
I used..."
12/23/2007,5,I've got to say....I'm benefiting from your years in search of the perfect eggnog!  I made a batch tonight for sipping on Christmas Eve and it has the perfect amount of sugar seasoning and crea...
12/23/2007,5,Instead of rum as I distaste the substance I used a very pale ale. (Blue Moon if you must know.) and heavy cream for the light using the ale to thin as needed.  I didn't do the clove thing as...
12/23/2007,5,Fantastic recipe!  It was wonderful before and after adding the rum.  I will make sure to double the recipe next time.  I put in half the rum called for and think it would be too strong with wit...
12/23/2007,5,I just wanted to add a few comments since some of you have had trouble with the egg yolks cooking.  The milk should just barely  come to a boil not a full rolling boil.  Make sure you pour the ...
12/23/2007,5,Delicious! Very thick very smooth perfect taste. Everyone at work enjoyed it and was shocked to learn that it was home made.  Told by all that it's better tasting than the stuff bought in the ...
12/22/2007,5,great recipe!  1st time i've made eggnog.  i wanted to make sure i got it right and looked at a lot of different recipes tips and techniques.  alton brown from good eats suggest to first beat ...
12/22/2007,5,OUTSTANDING!  The first time I made it I made a half-batch (just in case) but that was totally unneccessary!  The first person who tried it actually asked how much I was selling it for - he th...
12/22/2007,5,This was the first recipe I tried from allrecipes and the first time I made my own eggnog and all I can say is WOW!  I made it exactly as written but reduced the rum by 1/2 a cup and it was perf...
12/20/2007,5,Thank you for this wonderful recipe! I followed the instructions precisely and it's fabulous! At my holiday party I set up a fully stocked bar in addition to the eggnog and only two people out o...
12/18/2007,5,Wow!  We hosted a large dinner party and my husband decided to make eggnog.  We used this recipe and were very impressed at how easy it was to make and how good it was.  Thank you so much for th...
12/16/2007,5,Excellent! Cut the recipe in 1/2 to test it out.  Will be making the whole recipe for my cookie exchange party.  Thanks.
12/16/2007,5,OH MY GOD... absolute perfection! I used half-and-half because I couldn't find light cream in any store. I don't know how it was *supposed* to taste but I can't imagine it tasting any better th...
12/16/2007,5,This turned out really well.  I like the flavor and texture.  Next time i make it i will use vitamin D milk instead of skim milk.  I think that would help to make it a little thicker.  I will de...
12/15/2007,5,This recipe is really really good!!  Yummmmmmmm!!!  I like another reviewer slightly curdled my milk/egg yolk mixture while cooking (and I was sooo careful) but I too used my blender to smo...
12/13/2007,5,Holy Moly this will knock your socks off!!  I followed the recipe exactly and the end result was perfect.  Very creamy smooth and the rum is just enough to give it a kick!!  Awesome recipe.
12/13/2007,5,This made a wonderful eggnog! So thick and creamy! I used Splenda instead of sugar and i used 2 C of half and half and 2 C of cream to lighten it up slightly. It was quite heavy on the rum so I...
12/13/2007,5,This was delicious.  I used 10% cream instead of heavy cream and used a combination of cinnamon and cinnamon sticks.  A big hit and added all the rum although I was skeptical and it was perf...
12/13/2007,5,this was super easy and excellent! i got a ton of compliments on it - even from people who swore they disliked egg nog. i added an extra cup & 1/2 of rum so that it really packed a punch. delish...
12/11/2007,5,This recipe was absolutley AMAZING!  I had never attempted to make egg nog but was thinking of how great this would be to put in a basket of goodies for friends and family for Christmas.  I am ...
12/7/2007,5,This was probably one of the most ambitious recipes I've tried and the results are well worth the effort!  To temper the eggs pour about a half cup of the milk mixture into the eggs at a time a...
12/6/2007,5,I made my second batch yesterday and it turned out much better! I think using half and half cream really did it for me; my friends loved it. I left out the rum and put about a cup of sugar. It ...
12/5/2007,5,This is wonderful and I don't even like eggnog that much!  I think my sister in law would have drank the whole thing if we had let her!  We did serve the rum on the side for those  who wanted an...
12/3/2007,5,We loved this eggnog! It was well worth the work. We are big drinkers in my family and even we thought it was kind of strong. So next time I'll cut back on the rum:)Thanks for the great recipe ...
12/2/2007,5,This was the BEST egg nog I've ever had!!! It was soooo easy to make. I halved it for my test run and I wish I hadn't of! My bestfriend and I spent the day sampling the 'nog! I was expecting i...
12/2/2007,5,I've never been the domestic type; my first venture ever into the world of home-cooking was this year's Thanksgiving (crazy huh?).  But it turned out great with help from all the recipes on thi...
12/1/2007,5,This is in fact the best eggnog ever created.  I made it without the rum and it's absolutely perfect!  Even my husband who hates store bought eggnog really likes this.  Thanks for the recipe!
11/26/2007,5,Ohhohoh! So good! I did a half batch using whole milk (no cream) and omitting the rum (we have a four-year-old!). Because we used milk it was much thinner than it would be with cream but it wa...
11/25/2007,5,Not only did this make wonderful eggnog it made delicious ice cream too.  Just out of curiosity I put the leftover eggnog in my ice cream freezer and it turned out great.  I did leave out the ru...
11/24/2007,5,I made a double batch without the alcohol for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  I had no problems with texture or consistency. After cooling I added 4 cups of light cream and ten cups of milk...
11/22/2007,5,Super tasty and worth the effort!
11/20/2007,5,I've never made egg nog from scratch before nor had I ever had a homemade version so I couldn't say how this ranks in that category.  I CAN say that this was better than my favorite brand of s...
11/13/2007,5,this is the best egg nog i have ever had and it's easy! i was just getting excited today thinking about making it again soon. the stuff at the store can not even compare. this is so yummy esp...
11/12/2007,5,wow great recipe
11/6/2007,5,I only left out the rum.  I love this eggnog!!!  I don't think I let it thicken enough but still good for my first try.
10/13/2007,5,'Tis (almost) the season and this is a REALLY good nog recipe! Think I made about 30 batches for various holiday parties last year and even though it's only October I already have people askin...
9/25/2007,5,extremely good. dont add all the bottle of rum. got great reviews from xmas party
8/14/2007,5,So good.  I made this multiple times during the last holiday season.  People who say they don't like egg nog (probably have only had the store bought kind) love this egg nog.  And the fact that ...
3/23/2007,5,"Ill never by from a store again.
Option - cut the rum in one half - the flavor is still there but the alcohol effect is lessened."
2/16/2007,5,I made two batches of this over the holidays and we LOVED it.  The best was using it to make eggnog cappuccinos.  So good my favorite holiday addiction.
2/12/2007,5,This is head and shoulders above anything you could buy in a store!  I hate store-bought eggnog makes me gag.  But I loved this recipe!!
1/29/2007,5,I can't believe my first attempt at eggnog was this delicious! It was a hit at my Christmas party. It definitely needed the amount called for the rum...if not more. It's a definite keeper!
1/19/2007,5,This truly was wonderful.  I love the way the egg is cooked so you don't have to worry about Salmonella.  I actually cut the batch in half just before I added the rum so as my kids could enjoy i...
1/13/2007,5,This eggnog recipe turned out great.  I left out the alcohol so people could add the amount they prefer after pouring.  Thanks!
1/10/2007,5,My whole family loved it.  We didn't add the rum and I used half and half for the whole thing.  We'll definately make it next year!
1/6/2007,5,I didn't get the recipe to thicken much probably for fear of scrambling some eggs but even so it had great flavor. Thanks!
1/3/2007,5,This eggnog was wonderful.  Thick Creamy with awesome flavor.  I omitted the rum and it was very good.  I used a hand mixer instead of a wisk tho.  I also used a slotted spoon to take out the c...
1/3/2007,5,Made this for Boxing day and everyone loved it. I used less rum and let people top their drinks up if they wanted which a couple did. Next time I will use cinnamon sticks as I sieved this eggno...
1/2/2007,5,incredible! Really good. My son said he wished it had been thicker but I disagree.  I think he is just used to the artifical thickeners in the store bought stuff.  I may not have let it thicken...
12/30/2006,5,This eggnog is great I made this twice.  Once without alcohol and once with.  We felt that with had too much alcohol so we put in the other batch of eggnog and it was perfect.  I would recommen...
12/30/2006,5,This was suberb. I made a hugh batch for Christmas and then split it making one batch non-alcoholic and the other batch with Captain Morgan's Spiced Rum. Many many compliments. Thanks.
12/30/2006,5,This is amazing. I've made this twice and I have to say when the recipe says DO NOT BOIL do not boil! The first batch didn't boil was cooked very slowly and came out delightfully. The secon...
12/29/2006,5,I made this recipe for my family's christmas eve party. I had to double it because we had so many people. I added 2 cups of rum for the doubled recipe and it worked out really well. I'd imagine ...
12/29/2006,5,FABULOUS!!! My first time making eggnog and it was a huge hit with everyone! And very yummy as well! I used only a cup of rum like some reviews had suggested(even after adding 1 cup it was very...
12/28/2006,5,Wonderful egg nog and easy to make! Even family members who don't usually like eggnog enjoyed this recipe. Next time I will probably use a tad less rum but great overall!
12/28/2006,5,Made this for Christmas Eve and everyone LOVED it!!  My first crack at egg nog and I would make this one again.  The two things I did different is not cook the mixture until thick just hot and ...
12/27/2006,5,Awesome recipe!  I had no problems with curdling I think you need to go extra slow pouring the hot milk into the egg mixture.  I would also recommend dark rum - I only had 350mls and having tas...
12/26/2006,5,I made this for an open house I had. I am not really that fond of eggnog nor is my husbandbut we were having a very large Christmas party and I thought it might be a nice touch for those that l...
12/26/2006,5,This turned out great! It took way longer than 5 minutes to get to boil in the first step - I was afraid to turn it up too much though. MAKE sure you stir constantly during the 2nd step and take...
12/24/2006,5,Five wonderful stars.  Ok heres my dish.  I love this as does my boyfriend and were taking it to his moms house tomorrow.  I didnt use light i used heavy cream i read a previous review that said...

12/24/2006,5,This was simple to make and turned out really great.  My father-in-law who loves eggnog drank half the recipe by himself.
12/24/2006,5,I quit drinking egg nog 25 years ago when I found out my Dad made my beloved beverage with RAW  eggs! I haven't had it since I was 10! This tastes exactly as I remember with the bonus of COOKED ...
12/23/2006,5,Oh Wow!  This is fantastic best eggnog recipe I have ever made.  It was time consuming but worth it. It took forever to get it to boil.  I finally turned it up just a bit.  It came out smooth....
12/23/2006,5,Really good and suprisingly easy to make. Can't wait to make it for Christmas!!!!!
12/22/2006,5,"This recipe was easier than expected after reading the reviews.  A few minor changes I made:
I used ground nutmeg cloves cinnamon and cardamom instead of the whole cloves (I was out of them) i..."
12/22/2006,5,Excellent Nog! Store bought nog is too syrupy and sweet for my taste.  I decreased the sugar by 1/4 cup and only used 1 cup of rum.  The milk did not come to a boil in my doubleboiler so after 3...
12/21/2006,5,"Wow this recipe was very hard to master but the results were worth it 100%.

12/19/2006,5,We loved this! I used Silk soy milk and soy half and half because my friend can't drink milk. I also used Captain Morgan's Spiced Rum instead of the light rum and only put in 1 1/2 cups but then...
12/17/2006,5,I couldn't imagine I'd get so many compliments! Many people (including myself) said they don't usually like egg nog but this is fantastic. I used 1% milk and substitued more milk for the rum s...
12/17/2006,5,Yikes @ the rum!!  And I'm a rum drinker and thought it was too strong!  Aside from that the recipe is good more involved than my mom's old recipe (which by the way DID use raw eggs and nobody ...
12/17/2006,5,I made two batches for a party alcoholic and non-alcoholic both were a hit!  It's nice to have a recipe that cooks the eggs.
12/16/2006,5,Excellent taste and a creamy consistency. I really like the fact that it's cooked too. I used spiced rum and fat free half and half. Fantastic.
12/16/2006,5,This recipe turned out amazing.  We drank some the first night we made it but in the morning after it sat is was even more amazing!  We did make some changes as suggested by others as follows fo...
12/15/2006,5,Thank you so much for this recepie. No fear of raw eggs and I even use Soy milk.  Being celiac and Lactose intollerant this is really AMAZINGLY GOOD EGGNOG. Two thumbs up.
12/13/2006,5,I made eggnog using this recipe and accidentally only used 10 eggs instead of 12 and I intentionally omitted the rum so that it would be family friendly. It was plenty eggy and I would recomme...
12/12/2006,5,Just delicious! To suit our family I made it sugar-free (substituting Splenda) and lactose-free (using Lactaid whole milk). Still used the cream which is low in lactose. It is so great to be...
12/12/2006,5,"yum!!
i did it without the rum and since i couldn;t get light cream i just used the regular cream. it was a little thik but yummy nevertheless!"
12/12/2006,5,I made this for a christmas party even without the rum everyone raved how great it was rich and creamy!
12/12/2006,5,I made this for a party last year and I thought it was so good but nobody went crazy over it.  I am in the process of planning for the party again this year and all my friends have come to me o...
12/10/2006,5,the only change I make to this is to omit the rum so it's kid friendly.  My family loves this!  The flavor is smooth and just the right texture.  You will never buy eggnog again after making thi...
12/9/2006,5,awesome awesome eggnog.
12/8/2006,5,OMG! This was one of the best eggnog recipes I have ever tried in my whole entire life! It tasted like a little piece of heaven!
12/8/2006,5,Yummmmm.  Great consistency and spiced well.  I will reduce the sugar next time as it was a little sweet for my taste.  I left out the rum so the kids could drink it though I added a jigger of M...

12/7/2006,5,When doing this recipe pour the rum last and check to make sure it is up to your likes.  I made it with the original amount of rum and it came out super strong but it still a great recipe!
12/6/2006,5,Very tasty recipe & I'm an eggnog fan. My local store didn't carry light cream so I used 2 cups 1/2&1/2 with 2 cups heavy cream and that worked very well. Also used fresh ground ginger ( I use...
12/3/2006,5,THIS IS SO GOOD.  I LOVE that the eggs are cooked and that it tastes just as good with or without the rum as we can't have the little ones drinking... thanks for the Amazingly Good Recipe!!!
11/29/2006,5,This is the first time I've ever made eggnog but I left out the rum. I had a little curdling as well but I blended it and it came out perfectly! My dad said It has the perfect name it is amaz...

2/9/2006,5,This was my first time making eggnog and I was thoroughly impressed. It's gorgeous! Way better than any you can buy at the shops! My sister and I managed to polish it all off in one sitting. I h...
1/8/2006,5,Very nice recipe.  I made it without the rum.  I don't think I cooked it long enough it was still milky rather than creamy; however everyone loved the flavor.  On the first day the cinnamon was...
12/29/2005,5,Delicious!  I see why this would be a must make every year.  I used half and half instead of full cream and it turned out light and delightful.  My husband raved about it and I know he will beg ...
12/27/2005,5,Amazingly Wonderful Eggnog! My husband who hates store-bought eggnog loves this as do both my kids! I thought the ground cinnamon made it too gritty so I used 2 whole cinnamon sticks that ...

12/24/2005,5,"This truly is an Amazingly Good Eggnog recipe.
Delicious.  My first time making it and it turned out great!  This will forever be one of my christmas recipes."
12/23/2005,5,"Yep amazingly good stuff!!
I used half & half cream and a 1/4 less sugar. I seperated about 1/2 of it without the rum(for my nephew & me) and 1/2'd the rum. 
A keeper to be sure ;-)
I made this..."
12/23/2005,5,I just joined allrecipes just so I could review this recipe and one other I tried.  This eggnog is so good!  I served it at a party last night and I should've made two batches because it was gon...
12/23/2005,5,I would definitely make this again.  The only thing I would change is to cut back on the amount of cinnamon.  Also I didn't have whole cloves so I added a pinch of ground cloves and it turned ...

12/22/2005,5,I have never tried eggnog before but my boyfriend likes it. He always just buys some from the store then spikes it at home. I figured if he liked store bought then homemade HAD to be better. I ...

12/17/2005,5,this is an amazing recipe! my mom and i tried it and it is really good! thanks so much!
12/11/2005,5,This was a great recipe. It wasn't as difficult as I thought it would be. After it sat overnight the nutmeg became very strong so I may cut down on that nextime. Other than that it was very good...
12/7/2005,5,I have never liked eggnog (I'd only ever had store bought).. I made this on saturday and it was absolutely WONDERFUL!!!  My 2 and 4 year olds loved it too (did I say I left out the rum??!! lol)....
12/3/2005,5,This is a true eggnog drink Great with Captain Morgan's Spiced Rum!!!
12/3/2005,5,I DON'T like eggnog!  BUT....I LOVE this stuff!  Just tried it over the Thankgiving holidays at my brother's house and fell in love!  It is so delicious I can't imagine not having it every year...
11/23/2005,5,awesome!! very easy to make.  I used half and half instead of cream and you couldn't tell the difference.
11/22/2005,5,Great Recipe!!! I added one orange peel to the milk mixture then strain once milk boiled. Perfect for the holidays!!!!
1/11/2005,5,I don't drink eggnog so I don't have first hand experience but I made this for my dad for Christmas.  He loved it couldn't get enough!
1/2/2005,5,This recipe was great!  It was not too difficult considering I have never made eggnog before.  It was also not too thick.
1/1/2005,5,Gave this one out as Xmas gift to neighbours who have all returned the containers asking for refills.  A real winner think it is safer using the double boiler method for last stage to prevent c...
12/27/2004,5,"I had some store bought eggnog 12/23/04 and debated about even making this recipe I did not like the taste of eggnog at all.
I decided to make the recipe due to my husbands family being big eg..."
12/26/2004,5,Very good.  guests loved this eggnog.  Next time I'll leave the rum out and have on the side for those who want it.
12/24/2004,5,So good and wonderfully creamy!  Wow!  I will make this every year. It made about 2 litres but now I wish I had made 4!
12/23/2004,5,My first time making eggnog and this recipe made me look like a pro!! THANK YOU! Also thank you to those that contributed by sharing that less rum would be best I put half of what the recipe ...
12/15/2004,5,Excellent taste.  I used only 6 egg yolks instead of 12 1/2 and 1/2 instead of cream and a teaspoon of rum extract instead of the rum. Serves only 8 or so but it is less caloric and less costl...
12/14/2004,5,This was great very rich! Although I added a little more of the heavy stuff (Rum)since we have some big drinkers over here! Thanks for sharing.
12/12/2004,5,I've never liked eggnog but my husband insisted on making this.  Wow I never realized eggnog could actually taste GOOD. It was fantastic!  Just like the author says this is nothing like store ...
11/3/2004,5,This is so wonderful!!  Thank you for sharing!
3/3/2004,5,The name says it all.  Not too difficult to make if you're the type who would much rather do things from scratch.  Two things that I particularly like about this recipe:  1) the eggs are cooked ...
1/6/2004,5,This is Awesome.  I made it at least 3 times over the holidays.  I also left the alcohol (we used brandy) on the side and let people put whatever they wanted in as not everyone likes or can dri...
12/30/2003,5,This recipe was great!  It was my first Christmas to host and this eggnog was a definite hit.  I used less than 2 1/2 cups of rum and it was still great!  Thanks!
12/29/2003,5,Everyone LOVED this recipe.  My friends kept saying that the egg nog was much better than store-bought because it was not as heavy.  They said this version was so light (and I made it with half-...
12/28/2003,5,Wonderful! my husband is an egg nog fanatic & absolutely loved this recipe!  We omitted the rum and it was still fabulous!  We haven't found it in France & being able to make egg nog that is eve...
12/25/2003,5,I too will never buy store-bought eggnog again!  This was sooooo good!  I made it on Dec. 23 so it would be ready for Christmas Eve.  I omitted the rum and kept it on the side for the adults t...
12/15/2003,5,Sooooo delicious!  I kept going back for more . . and so did all the guests at the party.  Everyone was ranting and raving about this egg nog.  I plan on making this every year.
12/15/2003,5,This is the best egg nog I've every tasted!  If you don't rate this 5 stars then you don't know good egg nog!  Absolute must for your holiday celibration.
12/15/2003,5,I completely disagree with the previous reviwer. This eggnog is not bland in any sense of the word. If it turned out that way then she/he did something wrong when making it.  This is a very tast...
12/13/2003,5,This is excellent eggnog! I made a batch to try before serving it to our Christmas guests and will definitely be adding it to my menu.  This is nothing like store bought eggnog - far superior!  ...
12/7/2003,5,This is a fabulously simple and great tasting recipe.  I left out the rum as this time I made it more for around the house consumption rather than a party but the flavor and consistancy was g...
12/7/2003,5,I am from Australia and had never tried egg nog.  Was keen to though and this is pretty good.  Will definately make next year.
12/5/2003,5,I agree - oh my!  This is excellent.  It's in my refrigerator right now waiting to be served tomorrow night at a gathering of my co-workers.  I hope it makes it!  My husband is hanging around th...
11/24/2003,5,This eggnog is DELICIOUS a real winner. I made a batch to try out before the actual holiday event and I can't stop taste-testing! I used a darker rum just out of preference and grated a littl...
1/31/2003,5,Oh my oh my!!  I do believe this tastes better than anything you could get from a store it's so easy AND there's no raw egg!  Could life get any better?  This stuff is amazingly good.
1/19/2003,5,Excellent! This will definitely become a holiday tradition!  You can use up to half the rum and still have the flavor of it without getting toasted.  But depending on how hectic your holidays ar...
1/6/2003,5,In a word - excellent!  I will NEVER buy store bought egg nog again.
1/1/2003,5,This is fantastic egg nog! We served it new years eve and it was gone in the first hour.  I served rum and brandy on the side for our guests to spike themselves instead of mixing it in.
1/1/2003,5,Nataliesmom is my sister and I tried her eggnog for the first time this Christmas.  It was the best homemade eggnog I have ever tasted and better than store bought eggnog too.  I will be making ...
12/28/2002,5,"The only word I can think of to describe this eggnog is SUPERB!  It is very easy to make and it is 
deliciously smooth and creamy. I will definitely make
it again."
12/23/2002,5,This was a delicious recipe easy to follow and a safe bet with cooked eggs!
12/23/2002,5,"Living in Belgium I can not buy eggnog at the grocery in fact Belgians have not heard of eggnog!  I have found this recipe to be on of the best!  
I am now on a quest to introduce this eggnog ..."
12/21/2002,5,Smooth and creamy.... a delicious complement to a holiday celebration.  We loved it and will plan on having it next Christmas too.
12/19/2002,5,This was extremely smooth and tasty.  Will definitely make it again!  I left out the rum since we don't drink but left everything else the same.
11/29/2017,4,I'm making this for our holiday party at work. I use ground cloves so you don't have to remove anything and next time I make it I'm going to try to make it a bit thicker somehow. Haven't decided...
10/18/2017,4,looks good! will have to try it with Jameson whiskey. :)
12/28/2016,4,I've made this several times over the past three years now.  Delicious and always gets rave reviews from others.  I have tailored my version slightly to meet our preferences: primarily this is m...
12/28/2016,4,Definitely cut the sugar! I would have given this a much lower rating if I had not read about cutting the sugar. Even doing a cup of sugar for the whole recipe is pretty sweet but other wise it...
12/25/2016,4,I recommend half of the amount of rum the recipe ask for
12/24/2016,4,I've never been too crazy about eggnog but my husband loves it. I often throw out the yolks when I make omelets so this seemed like a win-win.  Perhaps not as good as store-bought but my husb...
12/21/2016,4,Good recipe!  Be careful when pouring milk mixture into the egg mixture or else you will end up with sweet scrambled eggs. Pour slow and be sure to have a large enough pan.
12/20/2016,4,Very tasty but thin. I followed the recipe to a T and it came out the consistency of milk. I am used to thick egg nog from the store. Any ideas of why this happened or is it always thin with the...
12/18/2016,4,"I only had eggnog once before making this recipe and it was store bought and 'yuck'. This recipe turned out very nice on my first attempt and has been designated a 'keeper' in our household.

10/28/2016,4,Yum! Didn't add rum and halved it and it was really sweet but I liked it! ??
5/7/2016,4,Smooth tasty and delicious.  I do double the spices (but we like things spicy). I also leave out the rum and let people add it to their liking.  I make it every Christmas no matter where I am.
5/2/2016,4,My family thought this was delicious! We didn't add any rum (just 1 tsp of rum extract) and we didn't have light cream so we used heavy cream and milk. Would have preferred it a little thicker (...
12/27/2015,4,Awesome eggnog recipe. However I did not add the rum as I felt the amount was too much and I was serving this to kids. I did add brandy to my glass. It was delish!
12/22/2015,4,I made this and should have held rum to 1 cup as this was way to strong for us. Taste would be good without so much rum.
12/14/2015,4,It was good but not worth the effort for me. We get same quality from the store with so much less effort and cost. I curdled the first batch then success on the second try. I will not make aga...
11/28/2015,4,As I write it is cooling on the counter.   I used half and half and no rum.  I don't like alcohol in my eggnog.  My hubby will probably add some to his tomorrow when it is cool.  It DOES taste ...
11/30/2014,4,I love this eggnog. I have cooked this too long before but went ahead and put it in glasses anyway. After it sat for awhile the solids separated from the liquid. So I ended up with a delicious c...
11/26/2014,4,I researched recipes and chose this one because I liked the cooking process she uses and her great ratings. I did tweak it myself. I omitted the cloves and used pumpkin pie spice instead of cinn...
11/17/2014,4,Very tasty - typically I like a little more booze in my egg nog but this recipe is solid.
12/31/2013,4,It was very good!
12/24/2013,4,gave this 4 stars but it was a close run for 5.  I read as many negative reviews as possible before reading to see what people were experiencing.  I truly believe if you use quality ingredients ...
12/17/2013,4,I really like this recipe. Since light rum was specified and I am not really sure what light rum is I went with Captain Morgan spice rum which is most delicious in this eggnog. I do use only...
12/13/2013,4,I made a small test batch to try as I have wasted alot of ingredients in the past on awful eggnog recipes. Nothing went to waste on this one as it was AWESOME!!!! I made it exactly as directed e...
11/20/2013,4,This recipe had great flavor and was pretty easy to follow but I love really thick eggnog and it lacked a little bit in that department. On average though one of the better recipes I've tried.
1/10/2013,4,This eggnog turned out excellent. I think using the full 2 1/2 cups of rum is a bit much it was too strong for my liking but was sure delicious nonetheless. Very easy to make too would defini...
1/1/2013,4,Nice creamy drink like a thin shake with a christmasy taste.
12/27/2012,4,I was a little disappointed with this recipe. The reviews made me very confident in the accurate eggnog taste this recipe would have. I just didn't like it a whole lot. It was a good drink but i...
12/13/2012,4,SO. Just finished making it- here's my twist. I used 2% milk and 10% cream. Instead of liquid vanilla I used 2 vanilla beans instead of ground cinnamon I used 2 cinnamon sticks and instead of n...
12/10/2012,4,Absolutely wonderful! I did cut back on the amount of rum and egg yolks. Instead of 12 I did 8 egg yolks and I used 2 cups of rum. That was enough for my taste. But I absolutely loved it. Everyb...
12/1/2012,4,I followed this recipe almost exactly.  The major change I made was the alcohol.  I used brandy instead of rum since it has a sweet smooth warm flavor.  I also cut the amount down by 1 cup -...
10/19/2012,4,This recipe was a little thinner than I typically like but the flavor was perfect.  (I used 2 tsp rum extract instead of rum.  We don't really drink much)
1/5/2012,4,Very tastybut never really got it to thicken correctly.  It didn't effect the taste though.  Will try again next year!
12/26/2011,4,"My first attempt at eggnog! I must have done something wrong though. There are small chunks in the end product.. I think I may have cooked the mixture too much.

However after sifting it its p..."
12/24/2011,4,I have always hated egg nog. I like this. I whipped the egg whites to peaks and added to the egg nog and used heavy cream because that is how my grandmother made it.  I did not add the rum and r...
12/24/2011,4,Was wonderful & everyone loved this eggnog.  Used half heavy cream & half 2% milk. Did have to cook longer than called for to make thick enough.  Will definitely make again!
12/10/2011,4,really good.  A little strong so next time a little less rum but the drunks at my party last night loved it.  ha!
12/10/2011,4,Delicious!  Not too difficult just make sure you temper your eggs before you mix them together.
11/9/2011,4,It was pretty complicated for somebody like me who doesn´t have so much experience but loves to try new things. It turned out nice but it didn´t blow me away and isn´t any better than a good b...
10/23/2011,4,This egg nog is very good.  I prefer more spices and less sugar. I also did not put any run.  But we all enjoyed it very much.  It is very important that the milk boil before you begin to add it...
8/23/2011,4,I made this last year and it was a hit.  Everyone has asked that I make it again this year.
8/16/2011,4,Very good.  Needs to be thicker though!
1/9/2011,4,Good but missing some flavor???
1/2/2011,4,Quite good but left out the rum. It was too sweet and it  left me feeling a little sick.
12/25/2010,4,Good recipe- easy to follow. Used almond milk and it seemed fine. Tasted great- liked that it wasn't super thick like some I've had. Biggest issue was the smell... very eggy. But other than that...
12/19/2010,4,Now this is real eggnog!  You won't find that artificial gross or syrupy tasting mess that is typical of store-bought eggnog here.  This eggnog is creamy decadent and natural.  In order to s...
12/15/2010,4,My grandmothers recipe is almost impossible to beat but it is old school and uses raw eggs (which as long as you wash the shell I’m ok with). I really like this -- only changes I will make is u...
12/15/2010,4,very good and not too strong!
12/12/2010,4,I will admit this is a very good recipe however I would advise using less rum. I'm sorry but it totally overpowers the taste of the eggnog. Although my husbands begs to differ.
1/2/2010,4,Made this yesterday with a few alterations.  My husband chose for us to use 1 cup Jack Daniels and 1 cup Bacardi light Rum.  I also whipped the egg whites till frothy and folded them into the fi...
12/31/2009,4,really good my problem was is strongly tasted like rum it wasn't super bad or had the burn when it went down. next time i'll cut back the rum
12/27/2009,4,Needs less rum but otherwise very good! I suggest leaving it up to the guest to top themselves off... then everyone wins!
12/24/2009,4,This is a very rich creamy egg nog. The recipe was easy to follow. I used fresh vanilla seeds rather than vanilla extract which worked fine and put in more nutmeg than the recipe called for t...
12/23/2009,4,Great taste but not thick at all. I left out the rum and let people add their own so I can't speak to whether o not 2 1/2 cups was too much or not. Also I kept the egg whites and beat them unt...
12/23/2009,4,Very good but too sweet for my taste. I also used half as much rum. I'll make this again with less sugar. Thanks for the recipe!
12/22/2009,4,did not add the alcohol.  this stuff is great!  very rich nothing like  store bought stuff.  i used heavy cream because i could not find light at my grocery store...turned out great although i w...

12/19/2008,4,it was good but its not common in our country so not everyone liked it.i used it as the milk for the pancakes the next morning and they were great pancakes!!
12/9/2008,4,I made this recipe last year and it turned out to tasted like real eggnog It didn't get creamy like eggnog.  It was pretty runny!
12/6/2008,4,I only used 1 cup of rum; 2.5 is WAY too much.  I also added the rum AFTER setting some aside for the kids and it still tastes great without the rum.  I only had dark rum on hand and it tastes f...
1/20/2008,4,Delicious! I converted non eggnog drinkers with this recipe...It's a bit of work to make but well worth it!
1/5/2008,4,Very yummy!  I had a slight problem with my eggs curdeling the milk so I took the suggestion of placing it in the blender and it worked like a charm.  Also we used 1 cup of Spiced Rum and it w...
1/4/2008,4,Very good flavor! It tasted like liquid ice cream with a kick....
1/2/2008,4,This was delicious!  I gave it a 4 because it seemed like a lot of work for a small amount of product.  I didn't add the rum so that kept the quantity low.  Everyone had about a half a cup and t...
12/31/2007,4,somehow i messed this up! i was tasting it throughout the prep but when i added the hot stuff to the cold mine didn't set right. but it was still good just runny. i will try again next year!
12/30/2007,4,I personally liked this but everyone else liked another recipe from this site much better.
12/27/2007,4,another recipe that i wanted to give 5 stars but it didn't quite rise to that level. i made a 1/2 batch (not enough eggs in the house on christmas day!) but it made a quart which is how i woul...
12/26/2007,4,This was my first attempt at making homemade eggnog and I and everyone who tried it agreed that it was WONDERFUL!!!! Thank you for the tasty and fairly easy recipe. It's a keeper!
12/25/2007,4,I gave this 4 stars because this eggnog was above average but not perfect. It wasn't really that difficult to make either. It was much thinner than I expected but I have grown up drinking the s...
12/25/2007,4,This was a great...it did not get as thick as I would have liked but that was probably my fault...I found that cutting it half and half with fresh brewed coffee is a wonderful idea and it tastes...
12/23/2007,4,I followed the recipe(that I halved) and it turned out great with such fresh flavor the only problem was it tasted a bit too rummy.. I solved this problem by serving it mixed with chocolate mil...
12/21/2007,4,very good I also added milk because of the thickness.. thank you very good!!  :)
12/21/2007,4,Like others before me I unintentionally cooked the egg mixture too long.  Our blender isn't working so I whipped the egg mixture with the whipping attachment on my food processor.  It worked wel...
12/19/2007,4,This was the first egggnog I have ever made so I don't really have anything to compare it to.  It tasted very good and was easy to make.  After I drank a glass of it I was so full I was unable t...
12/17/2007,4,This was a lot of work.  I haven't actually had eggnog for about two years because I live in South Africa.  I have to say that it does taste very good.  I didn't add any rum because I don't like...
12/3/2007,4,Left ou the rum so it was more sweet than most eggnog. I found a few drops of rum extract gave it a nice flavor though. I only had heavy whipping cream so I only added two cups of that and rep...
9/28/2007,4,I really enjoyed this and I don't even like eggnog.  Never will buy the carton again.
12/25/2006,4,This was good but NOT great in light of the effort and ingredients. It was a bit too rich for my tastebuds. My daughter who begs for eggnog during the holidays didn't like it. Of course she ...
12/22/2006,4,I thought the cinnamon was a tad too strong.  But otherwise good.
12/21/2006,4,Made twice.  First time was a little thick because I cooked it for about 20  minutes. When making again I was sure to not cook it longer than 15 minutes.  Took the advice and used half & half ra...
12/17/2006,4,Good but it doesn't taste anything like store bought. I'm not sure if that's a good thing. In all fairness I took the suggestion not to use the full 12 egg yolks and stopped at 10 and I found ...
12/8/2006,4,Our family prefers this recipe with spiced rum but it's a hit every year at our holiday party!
12/8/2006,4,"Hello everyone. Merry Christmas to you all.
I replaced the rum with Tia Maria...oooohhhhh   scrummy."
12/5/2006,4,Absolutely delicious!  I am still very much a novice in the kitchen but I managed to make this without any problems and it tastes fabulous. (We omitted the rum and used low-fat half and half in...
10/9/2006,4,Whoa nelly! I used a double boiler for heating the milk. Instead of whisking the milk mixture into the eggs and then back into the double boiler I just tempered the eggs with about 1/2 cup of t...
1/3/2006,4,I agree that the cinnamon was overpowering & will cut it in half next time. Other than this was a declicious eggnog. Very rich & creamy!
12/30/2005,4,This is pretty good but I like the Southern Comfort brand eggnog much better.
12/25/2005,4,Great recipe! I followed someone else's advice and reduced the amount of egg yolks. Being Indian I used masala chai spices consisting of cinnamon nutmeg cloves one peppercorn and cardamom(n...
12/23/2005,4,This is a very good eggnog recipe. A little too much cinnamon I would cut back on that a bit. Was a success at the family Christmas party.
12/28/2004,4,good but we didn't cook the egg yolk mixture in the sauce pan.  and we also beat the egg whites until stiff peaks formed and then stired that into the eggnog to make it thicker and creamery.
11/24/2004,4,GREAT recipe but add the rum slowly- I found that more than one cup of it was overpowering.
4/4/2003,4,Recipe is excellent espeically if you are making something with egg white and need something to do with the yolks.  Next time I would not use the rum at all and let anyone add it if they wish.  ...
10/25/2017,3,This was good ... not spectacular .  But My kids liked it . Next time I'll add less cinnamon . I whipped the eggs and sugar until light in color  didn't have one problem with the eggs curdling....
11/30/2016,3,I just left out the rum and found it tasted like cinnamon toast crunch did anyone else have that issue? I will probably half the cinnamon if not more. Will make again for sure
2/11/2016,3,It turned out a little too thick (my own fault while cooking). Rum taste is very strong.
12/30/2015,3,Only have it at 3 stars right now because I just made it. It was really easy to make didn't add the rum since kids will be drinking this also but it's going to be one of our New Year's Eve drin...
1/10/2014,3,I like my raw egg recipe better. I wanted to try this because I like the idea of making it in advance. Oddly to me it tasted a very much like store bought except not as sweet. My guests liked i...
1/6/2013,3,This tasted more like custard than egg nog but I still enjoyed it.
12/30/2012,3,Way too much cinnamon.  I had to strain it twice as much of the cinnamon formed clumps.  It tastes very much like the commercially available eggnog - nothing very special.  The recipe does make ...
12/31/2011,3,Too sweet if you don't use any alcohol (which recipe says is optional). Might be too much sugar with all that rum too haven't tried it. I strongly suggest starting with only 3/4c sugar; you can...
12/22/2011,3,This eggnog is only OK.  I have been making eggnog from the Joy of Cooking  cookbook for many years.  Of course this is better than store bought with all the store bought emulsifiers and prese...
12/20/2011,3,12 servings = 1500ml = nicely funneled into two 750ml wine bottles. Additionally the recipe tastes great but I had trouble getting the mixture to thicken at any stage. Almost all other eggnog r...
3/23/2011,3,I just didn't like this. A lot of time (and money) down the drain -- literally. Sadly I'd rather have store bought egg nog.
12/27/2010,3,too thick and sweet for me  maybe next time i use more milk then cream. also reduce the sugar and egg by one so it wasn't so thick.
12/23/2010,3,Ok DONT BELIEVE THE TITLE. I just made it according to the prescribed directions. I have found this too sweet and not impressed by its overall quality. The egggnog is not bad but it's not gre...
12/18/2010,3,I don't drink eggnog but my kids love it.  I'm giving this a 3 star mainly because they like store eggnog better but they're kids.  Didn't want to rate down for their opinion.  :-)
12/4/2010,3,I just made this recipe and my egg nog looks lumpy>>> I don't know what this means...
11/28/2010,3,Made this for the first time this Thanksgiving. Like the flavor but the vanilla is too overpowering almost like I'm drinking a vanilla milkshake (I left out the rum). Next time I will cut back...
12/23/2009,3,Don't think I made it right. It was chunky.
12/7/2009,3,This was nice and creamy but I expected it to have more flavor.  It was a very bland eggnog.  I think I will add less cream next time and bump up the spices.
12/24/2008,3,Im giving this 3 stars because I feel like it was good but it wasnt Amazing. I felt it had a good flavor but the consistency wasnt what I had expected. I like my eggnog thick. It does have a g...
12/20/2008,3,I made this for a party I was having and some people liked it and some didn't.  I had a lot left over at the end of the night. I didn't really like the flavor much; not very egg-nog-y.  I trie...
2/10/2008,3,tasted like a thick vanilla shake.. Maybe I did something wrong?
12/27/2007,3,I have to admit I was disappointed with this recipe given all the high ratings. It did not taste like eggnog to me more like a liquid version of rice pudding. It was good but just not like egg...
12/20/2006,3,Ouch.  I hate to be a spoilsport particularly with so many positive reviews and so close to Christmas but here it is:  I thought this recipe was just okay.  I decreased the rum by 1/2 because ...
12/12/2006,3,The flavor was good but the consistancy was too thin.  For those of us who are used to the creamy store-bought variety of eggnog I definitely recommend using heavy cream instead of light.  It's...
12/12/2006,3,I made it exactly as the recipe stated didn't change a thing and I thought it was the worst eggnog I've ever tasted sorry! I was so happy I found this recipe since I am in the UK from canada an...
12/19/2005,3,I thought this was a good drink but not good eggnog. It didn't really have much of that good old fashioned eggnog flavor.  Pretty decent holiday drink but more cinnamon or spice drink than egg...
12/14/2003,3,Well I know I'm going against the tide here but I just didn't think this recipe was that great.  I found it quite bland and blah acutally.  I tried adding more cinnamon & nutmeg but it was st...
1/6/2011,2,Not a favorite in our house...made it per the recipe.  If I try it again I will omit the cinnamon cut the vanilla by at least half and some of the clove.  Was just to spicy.  Liked the consi...
12/15/2010,2,Very nice - not like the store-bought eggnog I grew up on but very good. I took a batch to a work potluck and the older generation just raved about it. The younger ones could take it or leave i...
11/25/2010,2,I just made this eggnog recently and I was utterly disappointed. It had the perfect consistency but all I could taste was vanilla. It overpowers all of the other spices and it just doesn't taste...
12/30/2007,2,Way too much alcohol for my taste.  Didn't like the way it separated.
1/23/2006,2,This egg nog has a nice taste but because the eggs were cooked has a lumpy texture. I prefer the store bought egg nog...or perhaps this recipe without the cooking.
12/30/2003,2,This is one of three cooked eggnog recipes I found in AllRecipes but the only one I tried.  It truly is amazingly good and it's even better if left another day in the fridge for the flavors to...
12/28/2015,1,When I attempted to mix the eggs back into the other ingredients over the stove the eggs cooked and became solid even though the temperature was set appropriately.
11/30/2014,1,I did not care for this recipe.  I added half the sugar and it was still syrupy and way to over sweetened.
1/18/2013,1,I followed this to a T and it was awful.  It was too thin and for the amount of ingredients (not cheap by the way!) I should have just stuck with the Betty Cocker Cookbook version.
12/24/2011,1,I made this exactly as the recipe stated with timers and all and it still curdled.
12/18/2011,1,0 stars. This really smells bad.  I love egg nog and this is not something I can't even get past my tongue.  I should have known by the title amazing - the worst egg nog I have ever had.
12/17/2010,1,Amazingly good it is! I've used this recipe for the last 2 years! Since I live in Germany it'S hard to find eggnog. My family and I love it! I leave out the rum but thats all the ajustments I ma...
12/7/2010,1,I'm sorry but I can't give this 5 stars. The mixture was far to thick and didn't even taste like eggnog. Alton Brown has a recipe that I'll stick to......
10/13/2010,1,This is my first review  because normally the recipes turn out wonderful. But for some reason this egg nog did not smell... taste.. or even look like egg nog. My egg nog did not boil and it s...
12/18/2007,1,I did not care for this recipe.
12/27/2005,1,I am sooo so sorry but I nor my family that I had over for Christmas dinner liked this eggnog.  It was too strong in the liquor taste.  We couldn't drink it at all and believe me we are not a f...
4/30/2017,5,This was DELICIOUS. Just a warning it seems like a lot of vinegar but you can't even taste it!!
12/30/2015,5,Simple and tasty! I put a little less sugar in my rice just to cut back a bit. Crab meat is probably the easiest ingredient to come by and it tastes great in these rolls!
8/27/2015,5,My parents pretty much like my food so I decided to take on and larger challenge! You know what people say about sushi masters! I practiced rolling sushi and eventually I became a sushi maker! I...

1/22/2014,5,I have made it for a birthday present and as the main for my parents anniversary. They loved it.
8/27/2013,5,Pretty darned easy and passed the reviews of my sushi-loving family! A little wasabi on the side and it's happenin'!
7/30/2013,5,I'm in HEAVEN!!! Amazing and super simple! Never made these before so I wasn't very good using the bamboo mat. It was easier to roll with my fingers but I only spent a dollar for the mat on Ebay...
4/10/2013,5,I absolutely love this recipe! I added matchstick carrots for color and extra crunch. I used Kikoman's Ponzu Sauce as a dip just awesome! Way better Sushi than my local grocery store!
12/30/2012,5,I had no bamboo mat so I just rolled these using squares of wax paper. Just make sure the rice isn't so hot it weakens the wax paper. I'd drop my rice on it fold the wax paper over the rice and...
11/15/2012,5,oh my word. I was craving sushi for the longest time and now that I've made it IT'S SO DELICIOUS!
10/6/2012,5,We love this recipe. I leave the salt out and cut the sugar in half. We fill with cucumber carrot or avocado and cream cheese. Delicious!
6/10/2012,5,Great Sushi base!! I just did my rice in a steamer and it was amazing with this recipe. Of course being the sushi junkie that I am I had ingredients for 6 different rolls.
5/14/2012,5,This was the first time I have made Sushi and I loved it. I didn't roll it tight enough and next time i will make twice the rice. Very good and way cheaper than buying it at the restaurant and b...

11/15/2011,5,AMAZING!!! I had no idea that sushi was sooo easy to make! Already have made it twice- sooooo easy and oh so delish!
9/11/2011,5,My family had a great time making these together. So easy!! I followed the advice of other reviewers & left the sugar & salt out of the rice (my rice vinegar had plenty of sugar.) We also added...
6/1/2011,5,"Just some tips I have learned from making my own sushi:

An easy one to start with would be something simple like a tuna roll.  It's easier to roll up.

3/4/2011,5,I wish there were more stars. Sushi is my absolute favorite thing in the whole world. We spend $50.00 for my husband and I each time we go out... or at least we used to. This recipe is seriously...
3/2/2011,5,Excellent! The only change I made was that I put the ginger on the side rather than inside the sushi (I'm not a huge fan of ginger) and I halved the sugar. My friends raved about them. They were...

3/30/2010,5,I'm not a huge sushi eater but I really did like this recipe.  I took another reviewers advice and made a roll with bacon and avacado.  It was my favorite.  I will be making this again later in...
3/15/2010,5,Excellant...great flavor. I omitted the pickled ginger. This was a huge hit with everone even my 10 year old. I made the wasabi/mayo sauce that I found on this site...perfect!
3/14/2010,5,This was a great recipe! I will say the rice vinegar was a bit strong (next time I may try using only 2 tbs) but we will definitely be making this again.
2/28/2010,5,I didn't have rice vinegar so subbed with apple cider vinegar; wasn't too sweet like some other people thought but maybe that's why.  Used a large ziplock bag like one other reviewer recommended...
1/6/2010,5,This was a great recipe for beginers.  THis was my first time attempting to make sushi and my roll ended up about 6 inches in diameter.  I guess it will take me a coulpe tries to perfect the art...

10/7/2009,5,Wonderful! I use cooked salad shrimp in mine instead of crab meat - another inexpensive and safe alternative to preparing raw fish. Cream cheese is great in them too.
9/29/2009,5,Yummy!

5/5/2008,5,Great easy to follow recipe. I added less sugar about 2 tablespoons instead of 3 and used Cal Rose Rice (same as any Japanese sushi rice). Came out great!
5/1/2008,5,I ROLLED THE RICE ON THE OUTSIDE AND ROLLED IN BLACK SESAME SEEDS ON SOME AND ROE ON OTHERS.  TURNED OUT FABULOUS WITH SOME WASABI AND SOY.

3/30/2008,5,These were really good! The rice was perfect. I didn't used flaked crab because I think it's easier to use the leg-style. Now I just have to work on rolling them better!
12/23/2007,5,Great recipe I am a sushi nut! I could eat it daily. The only different thing that I do I pulse the crab or lox with a bit of cream cheese then smear in roll. I also like to serve it with plum g...
10/29/2007,5,"I was amazed that my kids ate these - AND they LOVED them!
I gotta get a sushi mat though the towel trick I found didn't roll them tight enough."
8/2/2007,5,A good take on the California Roll recipe. Left out the pickled ginger due to personal preferences but otherwise everything was really yummy! Best served with Wasabi.
7/8/2007,5,Perfect flavor but keep in mind that with every batch of rice the absorbtion of liquid will be different. You should only add a little of the sushi-su mix at a time and taste the flavor as it c...

8/5/2008,3,this can be california roll
4/3/2014,2,Way to much salt and sugar. I made a batch with 1 full cup of rice. Besides already enough salt in the dipping sauce.
1/30/2014,2,I'm going to agree with Mommyof2CutiePies after trying this recipe for myself.  While the rice vinegar sugar mixture does make the rice taste like sushi rice rather than ordinary bland rice it ...
8/23/2009,2,I LOVE sushi! In my opinion though this recipe is way to sweet with a big vinegar taste. I didn't listen to one of the reviews that said it was too sweet.....I regret that now. Luckily I only ...
1/27/2016,1,It's taste so vinegary. I suggest cut down in vinegar.
8/2/2015,1,Way too much sugar salt and vinegar for the rice. Next time I'll try half the amount of vinegar and omit the salt and sugar entirely.
11/19/2014,1,This one was like mush…wet and chewy... and had way too much salt.
9/14/2012,1,I did not care for this recipe. I wish I had read the reviews BEFORE spending my time on these. I have never eaten sushi so sweet.
1/22/2012,1,I did not care for this recipe.
1/15/2011,1,I have had homemade sushi and restaurant sushi and I didn't care for this. Way way too sweet. I made it according to directions and my rice was very wet and extremely sweet. I made it again and...
5/2/2010,1,Did not like nori
11/24/2009,1,This recipe is way too sweet. The sweet of sugar ruins the taste of sushi. Not recommend at all!!!!!
1/18/2009,1,I am flabbergasted by all of the positive reviews for this recipe.  The proportions are way WAY off.  Look at any other recipe for sushi rice and you will see.  This recipe has WAY too much vin...
10/19/2006,1,Don't dip your sushi maki in teriyaki sauce!  Stir a little bit of wasabi in a little bit of soy sauce for dipping your sushi.
5/1/2006,1,My husband and I LOVE sushi but this rice was WAY too sweet.  I suggest cutting back on the sugar big time.  I will stick to my original recipe.
10/29/2017,5,Number 1 husband-pleaser!  Like others I omit the salt.  I reduce the lemon to 2 T.  I empty the entire can of anchovies - including the oil into the blender.  Perfect consistency!  Dressing im...
10/13/2017,5,The best Caesar dressing. I blend mine in a smoothie sized cup for less prep. Increase/decrease jalepeno to your liking!
10/9/2017,5,This recipe has been added to my Caesar Salad Dressing recipes list. I have several that I I
8/14/2017,5,I was worried (or I should say others in house were) of using all the anchovies but it was really good!  I did not blend as I didn't want to clean blender and garlic cloves I used were large &...
3/14/2017,5,WOW! Amazing! Followed everything except for the anchovies because I didn't have them on hand. I used several splashes of Worcestershire Sauce (it has anchovies in it) and it was /is GREAT! I u...
1/7/2017,5,Excellent dressing! I'm glad I used my own judgment and did not add salt to this. It was plenty salty already between the cheese and anchovies (I used paste). Thanks - a definite keeper!
12/17/2016,5,This is a perfect dressing! Be careful not to add more garlic than it calls for. The recipe is perfect the way it is!
11/17/2016,5,This was fantastic! My husband loves Caesar dressing but store-bought is riddled with all kinds of things you can't pronounce. So I decided to give this a try. It was easy and REALLY good. My h...
5/15/2016,5,Love love this dressing. It is my favorite. I put a very large jalapeno with out the seeds for more flavor. It is as good as any fine restaurant dressing I have ever eaten.
4/8/2016,5,I love this dressing.  I didn't add the anchovies because I didn't have any but the taste was still wonderful.
3/5/2016,5,I made this exactly as directed for a dinner party. Was a little concerned because I'm not a big anchovies fan; so I made a second back-up homemade ranch dressing just in case. I needn't have...
1/20/2016,5,My husband loves Caesar salad and thought this was the best. Paired with the Best Croutons Ever recipe from all recipes.com it was fantastic.
1/9/2016,5,I have been making this dressing for a couple years now and tried something different by adding a little bit of fish oil with some smoked salmon and a little fit of liquid smoke  turned out awe...
12/14/2015,5,I halved the recipe and left out the anchovies (didn't have them) and the jalapeños (didn't want the heat). I used one giant clove of garlic and it was almost too garlicky even for this garlic ...
11/23/2015,5,This salad dressing is amazing.  I doubled the recipe for a large group but kept the amount of anchovies at 2 ounces.  I let it sit overnight and took it out of the fridge about an hour before s...
11/7/2015,5,No changes great as is.
8/11/2015,5,I've been making this dressing for over a year now and my wife and son both love it. The jalapeno with the anchovies provides the right kick to make this really stand out. If you do not like rea...
6/6/2015,5,This dressing is delicious I have made it two times. Because I thought it had a little too much garlic (even though I am a garlic lover) I cut back on the garlic the second time and liked it bet...
1/7/2015,5,I too omitted the the salt as the anchovies have plenty of their own and we LOVED IT!  It tastes like a very traditional Caesar Dressing with a zing.  I served it at a gathering in my home and o...
12/20/2014,5,Wonderful. I also held back on the salt because of the saltiness of the cheese and anchovies. I seeded my jalapeno and loved the flavor. I will never buy bottled dressing again.
9/8/2014,5,Very quick and easy to make. It was delicious!
6/23/2014,5,I have never made Caesar dressing before nor had I ever purchased anchovies - hah! I did both today and was happy that I did. This dressing is so much better than store bought Caesar dressing...
4/27/2014,5,OUTSTANDING Caesar dressing!!  I doubled this for a party-sized Caesar salad following the recipe other than omitting the salt (it was plenty salty w/the parm and anchovies).  I used all of th...
2/26/2014,5,easy and delicious.   I used anchovy paste instead of anchovies and that worked
2/10/2014,5,Loved this dressing! I did omit the optional salt b/c I didn't think it needed it. Also I reserved the oil from the anchovies and added a bit to the dressing to thin out so it would blend smoo...
9/11/2016,4,Flavor turned out fantastic with the anchovies but next time will use less garlic.
5/3/2016,4,Was surprisingly very good.
12/26/2015,4,This is good.  Makes a lot!  Did it all in food processor 2 days in advance.
6/19/2015,4,Great dressing- I love garlic and use it very often in the kitchen but I cut the garlic down to 3 cloves and it was still much much too overpowering. Next time I will add 1 clove at a time a...
1/21/2015,4,Good stuff.  A little thick but would make again.  This is a garlic lovers Caesar dressing stands up very good with grilled shrimp or grilled chicken.  Next time I might thin down with a bit o...
7/13/2014,4,Good dressing!  Omitted the jalapeño as I am the only heat lover in the family.  Liked the more pungent garlic and anchovy flavors you get in this recipe.
7/12/2014,4,this recipe is great! i only give it four stars because it is a little on the fishy side with how much anchovies it calls for. Also id put slightly less garlic in the mixture as one of my guest...
7/4/2014,4,Used in our café looking for a more traditional Caesar so eliminated jalapenos and cut down on the anchovies due to not all customers are anchovy lovers trying to make more palatable for a cro...
3/24/2015,3,Good recipe. It is a little fishy and cheesy so I added more lemon juice and about 4 heavy splashes of red wine vinegar. It gave it more zing and evened out the cheesiness and fishiness.
11/26/2017,5,I followed the recipe exactly and it’s fantastic! I made 10 lbs and stuffed them into collogen casings. I like that there are no additives and binders in this recipe only meat and spices.
10/30/2017,5,I didn't have most of the seasonings so I instead used a maple bacon seasoning for flavor.
10/28/2017,5,The first time I made this I made it exactly as per the recipe and it was very good but I thought I could've used a bit more flavor. Since I'm only cooking for two I usually use 1 pound of grou...
10/16/2017,5,this is excellent. I'm  a fourteen year old who usually has to cook for my fam and this recipe is way better than how i usaully make them. i added onion powder to mine though
10/13/2017,5,Great!!!
9/24/2017,5,One change. Rather than using ground pork bought a 2 pound pork shoulder blade roast from the fresh meat counter and ground it myself. Low fat content and minimal shrinkage when fried.
8/31/2017,5,Excellent recipe. The whole family loved it.
7/6/2017,5,I used 1 lb of ground pork so I halved the recipe and added about 1/2 to 1 (+/-)  tsp of garlic about 1/2 tsp thyme omitted the salt and used chili pepper instead of the red pepper flakes.  VE...
6/28/2017,5,This is excellent I only had 1 lb. of ground pork so I cut seasonings in half.  My husband does not eat a lot of sausage but does not hesitate to eat this sausage.
6/18/2017,5,I've been making this spice blend for a while now. I quadruple the recipe (minus the salt I add salt separate from the spices) and keep it in the refrigerator for anytime I want to add some spi...
6/16/2017,5,Added 29% ground turkey meat. Everyone loved the sausage!
6/14/2017,5,I made and my family loved it
6/5/2017,5,Loved it.  Added a bit more than a pinch of the cloves and it was delicious.  Made 3 lbs and need to get more ground pork to make more it went so fast
6/3/2017,5,Love this recipe!  I have a person in the house that doesn't eat anything but chicken so was looking for something to turn ground chicken into breakfast sausage.  This was perfect.  I highly rec...
5/18/2017,5,Excellent results and very flavorful. I cut the salt in half by using Kosher salt and used 1 teaspoon Summer Savory + 1 teaspoon Sage instead of 2 teaspoons Sage. Next time I would cut the sa...
5/10/2017,5,Made it exactly as specified except cut the batch in half so I could make any adjustments to suit my personal taste in the second half.   I couldn't wait 24 hours for the spices to marinate into...
5/9/2017,5,I cut the sage in half because we're not big fans and used half ground chicken and half ground park -- otherwise made exactly according to the recipe.  VERY good!
4/16/2017,5,I made this with 1/2 ground pork 1/2 ground turkey and I added some maple syrup to it as well. It turned out real good.
4/8/2017,5,After reading the reviews I decided to make this exactly as written with the exception of omitting the red pepper due to personal preference.  I was a bit worried since I was cooking it right aw...
4/7/2017,5,I raise and butcher my own pigs. Best recipe ever. I always get compliments on the sausage.
4/5/2017,5,Making it now a second time! I believe that the author has struck upon the optimal blend of spices. Savory!
3/11/2017,5,This was really tasty. I made it per the recipe from pork butt that i ground myself. Any excuse to use my new kitchenaid lol! I did cut back the salt after reading some of the reviews.  Then I m...
3/6/2017,5,Loved this. If you love Mr. Evans or Jimmy D this is better.  No garbage added flavorful and lean when using good ground pork.  Delicious. Kids just loved it!
2/20/2017,5,Locally we have very few choices of ground pork. I used a name brand (F. J. Extra Lean) and it was too dry for the first patty. I added some oil and ended up with much more success in forming t...
1/25/2017,5,Delicious!
1/22/2017,5,Excellent breakfast sausage.  I will make the patties smaller and flatter next time.  I cut  the leftovers up and put  in a quiche the next day and was delicious.
12/31/2016,5,"I made it the first time folloerd the recipe 
The second time added more brown sugar
My kids preferred the second but ate both"
12/24/2016,5,I added twice as much crushed red peppers and twice as much brown sugar to my caribou brat's mix. It is really tasty and one of the best breakfast sausage I have ever had.
11/26/2016,5,I used this recipe to make sausage for biscuits  and gravy and it was perfect. I was out of marjoram so I used a bit of oregano as substitute.  I'll be saving this recipe!
11/15/2016,5,i used this recipe the first time for 2 lbs of sausage and liked it so much we made 20 more pounds of it. family and friends think its the best they have ever tasted.
11/6/2016,5,I made it with 35 pounds of venison and 12 pounds of pork.  Excellent flavor
9/25/2016,5,I didn't change a thing and it was great!
9/20/2016,5,I have been using this recipe for years and just found out it's amazingly delicious with ground chicken so my family prefers the ground chicken then ground beef. And it's a lot healthier.
9/16/2016,5,I love this recipe! Tastes like the store bought breakfast sausage but I know it's a lot healthier and really good for my family.  I will never buy breakfast sausage from store anymore since thi...
8/21/2016,5,I looked at a bunch of breakfast sausage recipes and decided on this one. I made the sage version and followed the recipe exactly except  I omitted the msg. I used 80/20 ground pork. I thought ...
8/18/2016,5,Happy to have found a way to use other ground meats and flavor them like sausage. I was actually looking for a sausage recipe (to use in spaghetti sauce) that didn't use fennel - jackpot! Since ...
7/26/2016,5,This had excellent flavor. I used it in a breakfast casserole and my family loved it. I used 1 1/2 lbs of pork and the seasonings as written. It was perfect.
6/30/2016,5,So delicious! Only change I made was I used turkey.  Fast and easy to prepare! This recipe is a keeper!!! Thanks for sharing!!!
6/19/2016,5,Delicious with hints of sweet and savory.  I left out the brown sugar and added 1-2 T orange zest.  One half  the recipe yields 6 patties.
5/28/2016,5,Awesome  easy recipe to follow and taste delicious.
5/4/2016,5,added fennel recommend puncturing center before cooking so won't curl.
5/3/2016,5,people raved about this recipe
5/3/2016,5,Made this using grass-fed pork loin that I ground using Kitchen-Aid stand mixer with grinder attachment.  Following what at least one other reviewer suggested I doubled the sage (sausage has go...
4/21/2016,5,Great Breakfast sausage.  Will definitely make again.
4/16/2016,5,I halved the recipe.  I followed the recipe with maybe a little more sage and  crushed red pepper.   I didn't know the ground pork I was using from Walmart had additives.  It turned out a little...
3/26/2016,5,Excellent
3/15/2016,5,This recipe is amazing.  I no longer buy sausage at all. I wait until pork shoulder butt goes on sale for .99 a pound and I buy 50 pounds. Since the pork is low on fat I add a little more of th...
3/12/2016,5,Great recipe.  I used ground turkey and onion salt instead of simple salt.  I then formed them into individual rounds (60g each) using the egg-ring we use for making breakfast sausages.
3/5/2016,5,Very good as is but spectacular if you substitute demerara sugar (maybe a bit less) and 1/4 tsp freshly ground cumin for pepper flakes.
3/3/2016,5,We made this last night (breakfast for dinner).  We are never buying sausage again.  Wonderful!
2/16/2016,5,This sausage is incredibly simple and was delicious. I formed the patties and froze them individually (didn't cook them straight away). Cooked them from frozen and threw them onto english muffin...
2/13/2016,5,Aside from frying some up with eggs for breakfast I also ended up using this on a pizza with some sauted apples and onions. I'll definitely be making this recipe again.
2/2/2016,5,Very good and it feels great to tell people you made the sausage from scratch!  I used mine to make sausage gravy and because the pork I chose was lean I ended up having to add olive oil to t...
1/24/2016,5,This is a great recipe..my husband brought ground pork home instead of ground beef.  The only thing I could think to do was make sausage and this recipe fit the bill nicely
1/13/2016,5,So easy and delicious! I used half ground turkey for a lower fat alternative. I am from Vermont so of course I used maple syrup instead of brown sugar. Great recipe will make again!
12/28/2015,5,"I didn't have the cloves so I used a little nutmeg. Also I fried them in basil infused oil.

They sausage was amazing. Really impressed and so simple."
12/5/2015,5,"Exactly the taste I was looking for. I make this every time I pick up ground pork. Usually freeze half the patties before I cook them so I can pull them out when I want. 
I use cayenne instead o..."

11/22/2015,5,I used cayenne to taste instead of the pepper flakes (because that's what I had!) and I used real maple syrup instead of the brown sugar.  Best.Sausage.Ever.
11/6/2015,5,Sausage comes in many different flavors for a reason  some like it hot some like it sweet and some like it mild.  Using one recipe to please everyone is impossible sometimes even in the same...

9/23/2015,5,What a great simple staple to have up your sleeves! I made this as is the first time but have made it several more times using ground turkey instead of the pork. Another reviewer suggested apple...
9/22/2015,5,I make a large batch of the spice mix an store it in a mason jar. For the sausage I usually use ground chicken. I cook some in patties an some crumbles to use throughout the week.

9/3/2015,5,I have very picky eaters in my household when it comes to spices so the only change I made was to not use the clove. I bought two whole pork loins and adjusted the amounts to match up to the amo...
8/30/2015,5,I used fresh ground pork should. Better than pre made for sure

5/10/2014,5,Made this without the sugar and it was very good. Excellent sausage.
5/7/2014,5,We live where we can not buy breakfast sausage. We can't always get the pork either but the recipe works great for ground chicken too. We do like an extra kick so we add a little more spice too....
4/27/2014,5,Turned out  as is!

12/8/2013,5,Made it per recipe.  I'm not a professional cook but this was easy. Bought 2.5lbs of lean pork for $5.00 and a couple other ingredients I didn't have.  Mix it up and in a few short minutes I had...

10/26/2013,5,Very good sausage. The sugar works well with the sage. If you like your sausage spicy this is not the recipe for you.
9/23/2013,5,Used ground turkey and only made a half batch.  Very good.
9/3/2013,5,"Made an adjusted version of this. No brown sugar since I'm trying to avoid added sugar. No cloves b/c I just don't like the taste & no red pepper b/c I want to give some to my baby girl.

4/27/2013,5,Delicious! The whole family loves it. We use ground turkey instead if pork.
4/6/2013,5,What caught my eye was the brown sugar and plenty of it. I like mine a little spicy and to add the pepper and the black pepper look out. I use my own pepper seeds so I  am sure that this is a l...
4/2/2013,5,First time I made this sausage I followed the recipe (almost) to the letter and matched Jimmy Dean's flavor! This recipe is easy fast and predictably delicious. One change: I crumbled and fro...

1/14/2012,5,Delicouse!  Better than store bought sasuage.
1/14/2012,5,Really flavorful even with lean pork. I ground up pork tenderloin and cut the brown sugar by 1/3.  If you are watching calories fats and sugars a 2 ounce patty is about 65 calories.

12/22/2009,5,Amazing!! I made it with 1/2 pork and 1/2 beef. We live in Hong Kong and pay a fortune for sausages from the US and other Countries. I am thrilled to be able to make my own that have no MSG in t...
12/14/2009,5,I make this every Sunday for our full breakfast spread.  It's always the first thing to go even before the waffles!  Make it exactly as written and you shouldn't be disappointed.  *We add a bit...

11/21/2009,5,My new favorite sausage recipe!  I love the bit of sweetness this has -might try using maple sugar next time! I omitted the cloves (not a huge fan)   My salt crazed family asked for more salt bu...
11/20/2009,5,This was really good. It has a very nice mild flavor. I am going to double all spices next ime to give it more of a kick. Great great recipe!
11/8/2009,5,I'm so happy I found this recipe!  We followed the recipe exactly. We used a pork shoulder included all of the fat and it was perfect.  We used the grinder attachment for the Kitchenaid mixer....
10/26/2009,5,I used half ground pork and half ground turkey.  This recipe is perfect.  I made this for a family breakfast and everyone loved it from age 15 to 70.      I add a splash of water (just a splash)...
9/20/2009,5,I love this recipe! I use it with ground turkey and it really makes yummy turkey sausage. This way I know what is in it and it is very goooood!
9/5/2009,5,So yummy! Living in NZ there is no yummy breakfast sausage but now I can make it at home and it taste just like the breakfast sausage from the States. Thanks for this awesome recipe!!!!
8/22/2009,5,This is a very good recipe that adapted well to healthy cooking.  Substituted chicken for pork added 1 tsp of olive oil and 2 tbs ground flax seed.  All other spices stayed the same.  It was w...
8/2/2009,5,Oh my!  I made this with 1 lb 97/3 ground turkey and then 1 lb of the leanest loin I could find with all the visable fat removed.  I put the loin that I'd cut into pieces into my food processor ...
6/29/2009,5,We tried this recipe with a lean ground buffalo instead of pork.  This is a great combination of spices and beats anything we can buy in a store!

2/27/2009,5,Awesome recipe. I used 1/2 turkey and 1/2 pork. Also added a little more red pepper to suit our tastes. Made about 2 dozen patties for us - freezes very well.   Fantastic!
2/18/2009,5,Sausage as sausage should be!  Excellent blend of herbs and spices.  I used half ground turkey (93/7%) and half ground pork (which was nice and lean).  I used maybe a tad more of this or that se...
2/9/2009,5,We bought 1/2 hog from the butcher.  The ground pork he made for us was very lean so I did not follow the recommendations of others to mix with ground turkey.    This sausage is wonderful!  It'...

12/25/2008,5,Awesome. This made up for the lackluster eggnog french toast. There really are no changes needed.
12/12/2008,5,I was very happy with this recipe.  I had a group over for brunch and needed something extra.  Very simple.
11/30/2008,5,I used this recipe to make biscuits and sausage gravy as I only had regular pork sausage on hand. It was really good and easy!
11/5/2008,5,This is awesome! I made it as is with no changes. My husband said I could never buy sausage at the store again!
9/27/2008,5,These breakfast sausages are wonderful.  Served them to company and had to give them the recipe.  The only thing I did differently from the recipe was to mix the ingredients the day before othe...

9/1/2008,5,Lee…this is delicious and I make my own sausage.  My breakfast sausage is good; this is better.  I used low fat ground pork and added all ingredients without changing.  I did add a couple table...
8/21/2008,5,I used to use Jimmy Dean sausage for everything because it added such a zesty flavor to everything from pasta to pizza. When I ran out of Jimmy Dean I tried this recipe to spice up some diet le...

4/16/2008,5,Very good sausage I added a bit more sage (my preference). I used lean ground pork 16% fat whereas the store bought sausage I had on hand is 35% fat. In addition the protein content is 19% vs. o...
4/6/2008,5,This tasted wonderful and was very quick to prepare. My only complaint was that some patties were better seasoned then others...probably did not mix it well enough. I froze have the patties raw ...
4/5/2008,5,Absolutely fantastic! I love this recipe! I use cayenne instead of red pepper flakes.
3/15/2008,5,Impressive!  I honestly didn't expect it to be this good!  I bought a butt picnic roast and ground the whole thing for sausage; I ended up with 5 lbs.  I took off the large piece of fat on the t...

12/7/2007,5,Wonderful recipe espcially with the unstable and usually high prices for good sausage.  When I make this I use 1/2 ground turkey and 1/2 ground pork and the results are great.
12/6/2007,5,My family loves this sausage! We moved abroad several years ago and haven't been able to find store bought sausage that tasted like what we were use to having down home. This recipe is a God sen...

10/1/2007,5,We are on a low fat diet and this is so good.  I get lean ground pork.  It does not taste like your traditional greasy sausage.  Use cooking spray every so often to get the patties to slip out e...

4/22/2007,5,This sausage really is as good as the reviews indicate.  I have made it several times and find my favorite meat combination to be 1# ground pork and 1# ground turkey.  Key:  don't overcook.
3/31/2007,5,These were delicious. Simple to make but so flavourful. I happen to love sage so I went heavy on it(and the other spices too). I actually made these into little balls and fried them and then ma...
3/19/2007,5,GREAT it was fast to prepare and the taste is wonderful like the one you buy at the store but better since you can use lean pork. I serve for breakfast with eggs and also for dinner with steam ...

2/13/2007,5,Wow this was so good!  So easy to do and such a nice flavor- just like sausage you buy but so much better because you know what's in it.  Tastes fresher too.  I usually don't like sausage and ...
12/25/2006,5,I have been making this recipe for about 10 years+ now. I do like it to be a little more flavorful so I add a couple of things that I have tweaked over the years. And I have always added it to 2...
10/27/2006,5,This has to be the best sausage I've ever tasted.  I get cravings for it and have to make it about once a week on a weekend.  My whole family loves it and I've even passed it on to other relativ...

10/7/2006,5,This is fantastic! I just made it this morning and it was a hit! I can't believe how good it is. I left out the marjoram & clove (only because I didn't have any) and it still turned out great! N...

8/7/2006,5,I used rather lean pork for this so it was a little healthier. The flavor was kind of mild so next time I think I will increase the amount of spices otherwise it was excellent. Much better than ...

3/18/2006,5,I think this is a fabulous recipe.  I followed the directions completely except for the marjoram.  Didn't have any.  Didn't miss it either.  Fabulous.  Will use again and again.  Thanks for pos...
3/4/2006,5,"Outstanding
Restaurant-style"
12/29/2005,5,TRIED IT. IT MAKES VERY GOOD SAUSAGE. I DID LET IT SET OVERNIGHT AND I BELIEVE THAT ENHANCED THE FLAVOR.

11/13/2005,5,Best breakfast sausage I have made. Thank you

12/24/2004,5,This is an A+ copy of a very fameous Ohio based brand. Its a huge hit!!! They only changes I made were adding 2tbsp's of pure maple syrup and extra hot pepper flakes. Will make every weekend. Oh...
5/8/2004,5,This sausage is excellent!!  I like it hot so I doubled the red peppers and used a little extra black pepper. I also omitted the cloves because I don't care for that particular spice.  I tried i...
3/1/2004,5,I have made this recipe as written at least ten times always to rave reviews.
2/21/2004,5,I'm in Australia and this is so easy to make. I can finally have my sausage gravy again and I don't have to worry that I don't have packaged sausage again. I like to add extra sage pepper salt...
10/21/2003,5,Very good  you'll love this one
8/12/2003,5,We bought a 4H hog and had it butchered locally. This year I asked that they not freeze the ground pork and I made my own sausage. I made 18 pounds of this recipe not changing a thing. It is v...

5/15/2003,5,This sausage has the savory flavor of sage that's not overpowering. Wonderful combination of flavors and aroma.
12/8/2002,5,This came out wonderfully.  We had some of the spices come out in the gravy but it came out great.
11/29/2002,5,Fantastic recipe! Thanks for sharing! Great for being able to adjust it so it's not spicy!
11/1/2002,5,I always make extra and keep it in the freezer so its always on hand.
10/18/2002,5,I loved this recipe although if you use lean ground pork then be careful not to burn the patties!  Even my husband liked it and he's harder to please!
9/27/2002,5,This is the most delicious sausage I have ever tasted.  My husband loves spicy foods so I will be experimenting with other herbs such as thai basil lemon balm dill seed rosemary and tarragon...

4/16/2002,5,This recipe can't be beat.  It's so tasty and easy to make that I'll probably never buy store-bought sausage again--especially since you don't know what 'by-products' are in there.  This recipe ...

1/5/2002,5,Thanks for an easy tasty and quick sausage recipe for a beginner!!!    My family enjoyed it!!

7/17/2001,5,This was very good although I did change it and added 1/4 cup of brown sugar because my family likes sweet sausage which caremelizes as it fries.
5/7/2001,5,This recipe is fantastic.  There are only 2 of us in the house so when I make it I freeze half the sausage mixture and save it for another day.
2/1/2001,5,My husband loves to grind our sausage from a pork loin after trimming the fat. This recipe was wonderful. He may add some extra spices next time to kick it up a bit.
1/20/2001,5,VERY QUIK ! I USED FRESH GROUND TURKEY THE FIRST TIME I MADE IT AND MY BOYFRIEND WAS NONE THE WISER! EVER USE SAUSAGE IN SPAGHETTI TRY IT.
11/15/2000,5,this turned out perfect i and my family liked it a lotthank you
9/24/2017,4,will decrease salt to 1 tsp next time but delicious
9/12/2017,4,These were fantastic. The only reason I didn't give a full five stars was because I tweaked it a little based on my family's taste.  I didn't want a huge sage-y taste so I cut that in half. I th...
8/23/2017,4,Good flavor! It tasted like a nice restaurant sausage but without all of the preservatives. I did make one change as I am trying to be sugar free. I used a little erthryitol/stevia blend (THM Su...

5/13/2017,4,I made these but used 1 lb of ground pork and 1 lb of ground turkey and doubled the brown sugar.  They are awesome to freeze and have ready to make breakfast sandwiches on the go.
5/5/2017,4,This is a great recipe! But you definitely want to DOUBLE all the seasonings. (I used just a tiny pinch of red pepper since I have a two-year-old that will be eating them). Other than that it's...
3/8/2017,4,This is a good mild basic recipe. Next time I'll double the spices

11/3/2016,4,Turned off great.  Solid combo on flavors. Everyone who tried it loved it.
10/23/2016,4,I elimated the brown sugar and I have made it twice now.
8/15/2016,4,When I made this the first time 2 tsp of salt is way too much for me and I had to throw them out. I reduced the salt to one tsp and added a pinch of garlic powder and they were really good.
7/31/2016,4,My husband said he wants this recipe instead of store bought from now on. I just added a bit more salt and red pepper flakes.
7/24/2016,4,It's a good sausage. I swapped a combination of honey and maple syrup for the brown sugar for dietary reasons. It worked great. My husbands a hunter so I used 1 part port to 2 parts venison. I'm...
6/18/2016,4,Love this basic recipe but I've never had all the ingredients on hand so I cheat substituting where needed.  But it always turns out great even with a subbed ingredient here and there.
5/26/2016,4,I made it as is without the brown sugar (hate sweet taste or I would add maple syrup) - cooked a bite sized piece and it was good but needed a tad more sage. Added and will refrigerate overnight...
3/5/2016,4,I made this recipe and at first I was skeptical about how much sage for 2 lbs of pork. The flavor is very nice but I left the clove out. If you like your sausage spicy I recommend tweaking the c...

11/4/2012,4,Very good but a little too sweet for my taste.
11/4/2012,4,I tried this with 1/3 pork 2/3 turkey. Really tasty. I respectfully suggest starting with half the recommended amount of salt and frying up a sample to taste before adding more.
8/30/2012,4,Good and easy!!!
8/29/2012,4,His is a very nice basic recipe. I have used ground turkey for this as well. On my 2nd batch I added a tsp of garlic  and onion powder as well. It rounded out the flavor. Thanks for sharing this...
8/3/2012,4,These were really good. I didn't add the cloves and upped the brown sugar to get a sweet sticky sausage. Thanks for the recipe.
7/28/2012,4,Good but the seasonings need a little adjusting for my taste.
7/21/2012,4,This recipe is delicious!  No more store bought breakfast sausage.  If you use fresh sage do not add the salt to the recipe.  It becomes too salty.

10/15/2011,4,We like it but it is missing something. I increased the spices slightly adding a little fennel seed and liquid smoke (for a hickory flavour). Will read through the reviews for more input on ho...
9/20/2011,4,Had a hard time getting the seasonings evenly mixed in. I saw on diners drive-ins and dives a guy who mixed his seasonings in wine and water to help. I will try that way and see if it helps beca...
9/16/2011,4,I really like this recipe.  I am giving it four stars because I needed to make some adjustments for my taste.  I do not use the marjoram basically because I do not care for that spice and do not...
9/13/2011,4,I don't even like sausage but I loved this!
8/14/2011,4,Pretty good but a little too salty for my tastes.
8/13/2011,4,Have made this twice now. I use 80/20 ground pork as  we found the 85/15 a little too dry.  If you want to use it to make sausage and gravy use 75/25 or 70/30 if you can find it.  Otherwise you...
8/8/2011,4,So good. I subbed the pork for turkey but it was made perfect when I doubled the sage and bumped up the marjoram to a rounded tsp. That makes it 5 stars. I am glad to finally not have to buy sau...
7/29/2011,4,This is a great recipe however I add ground fennel seed (grind your own with a spice grinder or coffee grinder) and that gives it a real great taste. I fry mine all at once then freeze the pat...
7/18/2011,4,When making sausage of any kind being ItalianBrats or Breakfast Patties. It is always best to let your seasoned meat rest in the fridge over night to flavor thru before putting it in casings o...
7/6/2011,4,This was just what I was looking for! I halved the recipe and used 1lb of ground turkey instead of pork. I didn't have cloves so I left that out and was out of marjoram so I substituted that w...
6/5/2011,4,A great recipe for a very mild sausage.  Next time I make it I will increase the peppers and the other spices.  A good basic recipe for elaborating with as well.  You can use any ground meat and...
5/11/2011,4,I used turkey and added some cayenne... So good!
4/23/2011,4,I'm on a strict diet that doesn't allow for any sugar whatsoever and there's sugar in breakfast sausage so I bought 2.5 lbs of ground pork and added these ingredients minus the brown sugar. It ...
4/19/2011,4,Good but a bit bland. I used fresh herbs and doubled them up but it is still lacking a bit of flavor.
3/16/2011,4,Real good. I made it with ground turkey instead of pork.
3/11/2011,4,It's good.  Taste like really fresh store brand sausage with out the fat.  I was looking for a different taste though.  I've had some homemade sausage that woule knock your socks off.  This didn...
10/2/2010,4,A little sweet for my taste. I'll cut back on the sugar a bit next time and add a bit more of a kick to it. So much cheaper and better for you than the store bought.
9/4/2010,4,Made as directed except with 1/2 of salt.  Wish I had kept the original amount!  This was good not what I was expecting but good.  Ok just doctored up my batch I added one tsp ground thyme...
8/28/2010,4,This is  so good !!! I made it for my husband and he love it .... !
4/7/2010,4,This was good.  I used ground turkey and added 1/2 teaspoon of crushed fennel seed.
2/25/2010,4,Having never made sausage before I was skeptical about this but after making it I was really pleasantly surprised.  The flavor was nice just added more red pepper flakes for a bit more zing. ...
2/18/2010,4,I really liked it but I wasn't a big fan of the cloves.  The smell overpowered the blended taste.
2/10/2010,4,Like other reviewers I'm supposed to stay away from processed foods so I was thrilled to find this recipe.  (Who wants to give up sausage?!!)  If I had known how easy it is to make great sausa...
1/11/2010,4,Great sausage. I made this sausage from some fresh pork and it turned out so well. It is really easy to prepare and the kids simply love it.
1/5/2010,4,Good stuff I doubled both peppers for a hotter personnel taste.   Thanks
12/26/2009,4,This was good but not spicy enough for our tastes.  I'll be making it again though and experimenting with the seasonings until I get it right for us.  Great base recipe though.
10/4/2009,4,We both liked this recipe.  Made as written and altered for 2 servings it is quite delicate in flavour and made enough for breakfast with leftovers.  I might be tempted to alter some of the sp...
6/18/2009,4,Very good sausage easy and good flavor. I added a little ground cayenne and by mistake added too much brown sugar. I'm sure I will like it better with the right amount of brown sugar. Thanks fo...
1/2/2009,4,This was exceptionally good though I'll admit I didn't have any Sage around so I had to improvise slightly (followed some others' recommendations of subbing in Italian spices & fennel seed).  I...
12/25/2008,4,very good as is. next time i will use the same spices but just a bit more of them for my own taste preference.
12/15/2008,4,i made this for my boyfriend because he LOVES breakfast foods. he's not the biggest fan of sausage but i like it. i figured this would be a much healthier way of eating sausage since it's usuall...
12/7/2008,4,While this is incredibly tasty both my husband and I agree this recipe is a great starting point for breakfast sausage. Which is why I gave it 4 stars. We'll definitely make it again but make ...
12/2/2008,4,great recipe....we love it. Only changed to less red pepper since we don't like spicy things.
8/22/2008,4,This is really good.  I add a pinch more of everything except brown sugar and cloves to a 1 lb. pkg of pork.  Using lean pork will result in drier patties.  1 lb. made 9 2 1/2 - 3 patties/4 se...
7/13/2008,4,I used this recipe and substituted turkey for the pork.  I left out the red pepper and added the other ingredients to taste.  It turned out great and I will definately fix it again.
5/31/2008,4,Great recipe.  I am on low salt diet so reduced salt to 1/2 tsp and added 1/2 tsp mace.  Turned out great.
3/19/2008,4,Great!
7/4/2007,4,Great recipe and veyr easy. Also recommend leaving the pork overnight in the spices.
6/29/2007,4,i used this recipe in conjunction with the alton brown recipe- used 3 t fresh sage 3 t fresh thyme and 1 t fresh rosemary plus more 1/4t red pepper flakes for kick.  let sit overnight to let t...
5/6/2007,4,quite yummy.  I followed another poster's suggestions and added some finely chopped apple as well.
5/14/2006,4,"These had the perfect amount of spices and tasted very much like McDonald's breakfast sausage but in a great way. 
I think next time I would buy less sausage and make the patties smaller becau..."
1/14/2006,4,Great recipe.  I think I will use a little less brown sugar next time.  I prefer this to any brand I have tasted.
11/6/2005,4,I can't believe how hard of a time I had trying to find a homemade sausage recipe! I am so glad you posted this one Lee :) It gave me a good base to create my own and tweak the seasonings. I lef...
12/25/2004,4,I used ground turkey to save fat and upped the red pepper a bit. Hubby liked it cooked it as bulk sausage with gravy over biscuits.
8/15/2004,4,I'm never buying frozen sausage patties again! These were great and very simple to throw together. You do have to be careful with the cloves though or they'll overpower the entire sausage. Than...
7/22/2004,4,This came out pretty good but not as tasty as the store bought that you have no idea what's in them... next time I would make the patties thinner than I thought was ideal this time.. I'll try t...
5/26/2004,4,This sausage is really really good.  Other people suggested there was too much salt so I used 1 1/2 teaspoons and I thought it was just right.  I used the cloves but will omit this next time.  ...
1/7/2004,4,Tasty and very simple to make - followed recipe exactly - I would cut back on the sugar a little and add more pepper flakes - but that is simply my preference. My only complaint was that they we...
11/9/2003,4,This morning I prepared this breakfast sausage but cut the recipe in half.  I already had ground pork sausage (with grounded up onions and garlic in it) before adding the remaining ingredients...
8/7/2003,4,Good sausage. Not the best I've ever tasted but an easy and tasty one. Will try to add maple syrup in the meat mixture next time.
5/9/2003,4,I used 2 tsps.dried ground sage for 6 1/2 lbs of ground 95% lean pork.  All other spices I scaled to three times the base recipe.  Outstanding sausage.  I will never by prepared sausage again th...
12/30/2002,4,I used ground Italian sausage since we like a lot of flavor. I also used another reviewer's tip and froze the patties ahead of time. On Christmas morning all I had to do was take them out of th...
9/24/2002,4,This recipe was soo easy and tasted pretty good!  I didn't have marjoram or cloves and all I had was some ground sage and the Italian Spices (which contained a bit of rosemary marjoram sage et...
1/5/2002,4,Very good spicy sausage although a bit sweet for me.  I cut brown sugar to 1 teaspoon. Maybe too spicy for kids or those with sensitive palate.  I used this recipe for ground pork from a wild ho...
8/27/2001,4,Delicious and very easy to prepare.  I like to brown the outside in a skillet and then bring the internal temp up in the microwave.
7/21/2017,3,needed more spice
6/11/2017,3,I've been on a search for homemade breakfast sausage and this is the closest to the flavor I want. It's good but something is still missing. I'll follow the most helpful critical review and dou...
3/29/2017,3,I will make again but this time I wwill use 1/2 the sage it calls for
12/11/2016,3,I think that this is a good recipe. However I would like to stress that one key factor should be included with the  ingredients. And that is make sure when you buy your ground pork that it has ...
10/16/2016,3,We did not care for the flavor of these sausages. The blend is seasonings wasn't my family's favorite.
4/26/2016,3,This was okay but it was not strong enough. Martha Stewart's is perfect.
2/15/2016,3,I might try this again with different seasonings.  Way too much clove for my taste.  I also used a combination of ground beef/pork that they had on sale at the store but it was way too dry.
12/19/2015,3,2nd time making them: I used the higher fat content ground pork this time (30% fat). That definitely helped but still these did not taste like the ground breakfast sausage meat you can get at t...
4/7/2015,3,I really disliked the clove flavor in this sausage but the rest of the spices were a pretty good mix. Next time I'll leave the clove out entirely.
3/30/2014,3,This is a good recipe as is but I used the second tome around ground chicken not pork and I doubled it and frozen it down to two patties in a bag. Just me here now. And this is a good way to ke...
2/5/2014,3,I took a fresh boneless shoulder and ground it (2 lbs) and made it to the recipe (doubling all qtys). Overall it came out very well balanced - a good place to start if you like your sausage mor...
12/15/2012,3,Added double the pepper 2T oil and some onion powder and was great.
12/2/2012,3,I added 50% more spices so that the flavor is more like breakfast sausage should be.  I also added 1/8 cup water per pound to add moisture.  The one thing I would do next time is to use an 80/20...
11/16/2011,3,This had a good flavor but I'm not sure it's worth it unless you have a problem with additives.  Mine were a light color as compared to supermarket and seemed to be a little dry.
4/18/2011,3,I added more sage and red pepper flakes I wish I reduced the sugar.
8/13/2010,3,This was pretty good but not quite what I was looking for.  I didn't have marjoram so maybe that made a difference?  My husband thought it tasted fruity.  I will keep looking!
7/12/2010,3,The flavor in these was very plain and didn't remind me of the sausage I get in the store at all. I didn't even make the whole batch...ended up tossing the leftovers. Sorry this just wasn't for...
2/28/2010,3,I'm giving this recipe 3 stars as is.  I made this today and enjoyed it prepared as is.  My family & I thought it was a bit bland.  I think I would basically double all spices besides salt & p...
6/28/2009,3,I was disappointed on the first attempt - the finished product seemed tough and dry. It may have been the fault of the ground pork I used - packaged right from the meat case. It may have been t...
3/26/2009,3,bland
8/4/2008,3,These were a bit dry and hard I probably cooked them longer than needed. The taste was good but not good enough for me to try this one again.
12/26/2016,2,Made it and could hardly tell there were spices in it.  It would double the spices next time.
1/11/2016,2,This didn't work for me.
3/13/2013,2,Waaaaay too strong. I don't know if it was too much salt or what but it really rubbed me the wrong way.
9/27/2002,2,Found them OK but lacking a certain flavor - not sure what spice was missing but I don't like sage much so perhaps didn't use enough.
10/31/2009,1,Too dry. Needs fat. I made a recipe myself once and just cannot remember how I made it.  This was not it!
2/7/2009,1,My family normally loves sausage-there is never any left. this time however we had 4 patties left. I thought there was far to much seasoning in it. It was easy to make but the flavor was just no...
8/19/2003,1,I'm sorry but this had no taste at all. I had to triple all the spices(not the salt) to try to get some kind of flavor. I will keep looking.
11/29/2017,5,I've made this again and again for large crowds. Nothing but rave reviews!
11/24/2017,5,Easy and delicious way to make scrambled eggs for a crowd. Light and fluffy. Will definitely make again.
11/5/2017,5,These are excellent.  Period.  I followed the recipe exactly but the only complaint I have is I had to cook them MUCH longer than the recipe called for.  I baked for 10 mins. and stirred and it...
10/28/2017,5,Very easy tasted great and I think you could alter it in many ways (add veggies meat etc.). The only thing that needed adjusted was cooking time. It took almost twice as long as directed. Kee...
9/25/2017,5,I had 12 people over for brunch and took a chance on this recipe as a way to make a lot of eggs at once. My husband told me they were the best scrambled eggs he's ever had! The only thing I woul...

12/22/2016,5,First time I made scrambled eggs in the oven and it came out fantastic. Compliments all around at brunch. To make it richer I used cream instead of milk.
12/17/2016,5,Love this recipe.  My whole family loves this recipe.  Great way to feed guests.  Very simple to make .  I have had the eggs over flow a couple of times so be aware of that possibility.

10/26/2016,5,These were so delicious!  My husband loves scrambled eggs but when I make them on the stove top it is hard to get them just right.  Not  so with this recipe.  They were moist fluffy and delic...
10/7/2016,5,Just like the scrambled eggs at the hotel hot breakfast buffets.  Quick tip: put butter in the cooking pan/dish and let butter melt in oven while oven is preheating. Pour egg mixture into hot di...

9/12/2016,5,What a timesaver! I added 2 pounds of cooked breakfast sausage and 12 slices of American cheese. Then the eggs go into tortillas and into the freezer for breakfast burritos. When daughter #2 goe...

7/10/2016,5,This is an amazing recipe! I have made it several times for large breakfasts and brunches. I reduced the butter to 1/2 cup and it was fine. Be sure to stir the eggs at 10 minutes as directed.

5/9/2016,5,These turned out perfectly. The only change I made was to turn the broiler on high for 2 mins after they were done because my husband likes the little crispy egg bits.
5/8/2016,5,This was awesome! Before I go further though a shout out to the person who gave this one star because they used WATER instead of the milk or cream. SeriouslY? A SMALL amount (like a teaspoon or...

11/29/2015,5,Great recipe.  Made it as written but  after 10 minutes I stirred in cheddar cheese sautéed mushrooms and baby spinach.  I used a  11 x 15 baking dish to accommodate the additions.  It took 25 ...

3/28/2014,4,Easy light and fluffy but too much butter and salt.
2/8/2014,4,So I live in low altitude...yes that makes a difference. I make 6 eggs with 1/4 cup melted butter in 2 quart casserole dish. I added 3/4 cup milk 1/3 cup black bean salse and salt garlic and c...
1/1/2014,4,The 2 1/2 cups of milk was way too much in my opinion.  I'll cut it down to 1 cup or less next time.  I added cheese pepper salsa and crushed tortilla chips to mine and it was similar to miga...
12/16/2013,4,Really lovely - the eggs turned out quite fluffy and had a nice texture.   The only change I'd make is to use less butter next time; however these are otherwise fabulous and a GREAT go-to when ...
11/17/2013,4,This idea freaked me out a little so what better time to test it than on a birthday brunch for my Mother with the whole family attending(sarcasm).  I cut the recipe in half and used a smaller p...
10/20/2013,4,Probably the best and easiest recipe I have found for making scramble eggs. They are light and fluffy and have good flavor. Also its much easier than standing over the stove since you pretty mu...
9/14/2013,4,I'm planning a huge breakfast 125 people! I made one pan as a test and I'm torn whether or not I should use this recipe. The eggs were beautiful and fluffy however the time it takes to cook i...
6/30/2013,4,maybe 1/2 the butter
5/18/2013,4,I made this recipe last year and it was way too much butter and it took longer to cook than the recipe stated. But I just recently made it again only a half recipe. I used half the amount of bu...
4/18/2013,4,These were nice and fluffy.  We were surprised but they did seem a little something.  I guess it's a texture thing.
2/28/2013,4,I'm really glad I came across this recipe I see it becoming very handy in some large gatherings coming up.
2/15/2013,4,These are fine and good for when I am making various other things since I can just leave them.  However mine NEVER cook in the stated 25 minutes.  It's always closer to 40 even with a higher o...
12/24/2012,4,Very easy. Nice fluffy eggs. I loved them and I am not an egg person. My family (the egg lovers) thought they were good but didn't rave about them.
12/6/2012,4,Great for a group
11/25/2012,4,Great if you don't mind the extra wait. We like scrambled eggs right off the stovetop but they definitely seem much fluffier coming out of the oven. Sprinkle some cheese on top right after takin...
8/11/2012,4,add more seasonings to your taste
5/29/2012,4,These were great! They turned out super fluffy. Very easy way to feed a crowd for brunch.
4/9/2012,4,Very good surprised
4/7/2012,4,Took a lot longer to cook than recipe states - but they were good!
3/22/2012,4,good easy--used rice milk--think I would try with half the butter next time
3/21/2012,4,I thought these eggs were delicious though very rich. My husband who usually eats 4 times as much as I could only eat a small serving of these eggs. I would suggest leaving the butter out or...
3/15/2012,4,I cut this recipe in half and can't imagine it fitting in a 9x13 pan with the whole amount.  I used a slightly smaller pan but next time I will use the 9x13 with the recipe cut in half.  I foun...
3/6/2012,4,This is my go to for a brunch crowd.  The reason for 4 stars is the milk makes the eggs runny. I replace the milk with about 1 cup of light sour cream to prevent the baked product from becoming ...
3/5/2012,4,My first ttrempt came out sort of bland I tried it again with substituting 1 can of rotel tomatoes for 1 cup of the milk Also added a little garlc powder and sprinkled just a little paparika o...
3/4/2012,4,Good recipe. My only criticism is that is is way too salty for my taste. I will definitely make it again using un salted butter plus the salt called for in the recipe. I can always add more sal...
3/4/2012,4,It's just me and the dog so I cut this recipe in half cooked it in a 8x8 pan and added 1 c of shredded cheese.  It was very good!
3/4/2012,4,I add heavy cream instead of milk and smoked salmon for that special meal
2/9/2012,4,Followed the recipe exactly and it was very good. Although next time I would cut the amount of butter in half...or more. There was so much butter that parts of the top had a layer of it. Other ...
1/28/2012,4,I made for 3 people and the serving converter worked out fine. The only thing I did differently was to add some cheese.  Was fine as is but next time I will try some crumbled bacon and green ch...
1/18/2012,4,I will never scramble eggs on the stovetop again!  So easy.  I gave 4 stars instead of 5 b/c of the butter/salt content.  Just not necessary.  I sprayed pan w/ canola oil and used 1/2 tsp salt. ...
1/16/2012,4,I modified the recipe to feed 4 but used all the same ingredients. It is an easy receipe to feed a crowd but it is a little blander than scrambling them in a pan.  I think next time I'll use a ...
1/15/2012,4,Very good and easy....next time will add something like cheese or peppers/onions. Used less butter halved recipe and baked in a smaller dish
1/15/2012,4,Good starter recipe. Some liked it/some didn't. They said it needed more flavor. Will add sausage sauteed shrooms onions red pepper and more cheese next time. Can change it up in whatever you...
12/22/2011,4,Love the eggs. Made them 4 times. But the total cooking time was 50 minutes not 35
10/18/2011,4,This was the perfect recipe for a function I made breakfast burritos for. The only thing I would change is the amount of butter. Once I took the pans out it seemed like a layer of butter was jus...
10/11/2011,4,I love these eggs. They are so easy and they stay moist.
10/5/2011,4,I cut the recipe in half using an 8x8 pan.  They were quite salty but other than that very yummy and something I'll make in the future.
9/13/2011,4,Amazing! I added some cheese when I stirred it and cut the liquid a little. Everyone at my brunch raved!
5/2/2011,4,Made a 1/2 batch for egg/bacon sandwiches on bagels.  Added some shredded cheese to the mix before baking and put it in a smaller glass pan.  Took alot longer to cook doing it that way and made ...
4/26/2011,4,These were quite good but I found the cooking time and amount of liquid / salt called for to be WAAY off. Because of this I can only award 4 stars. The concept of this alone makes this a 5 sta...
3/12/2011,4,The recipe calls for waaaaay too much salt. Adjust according to your saltiness preference. Just beware
11/12/2010,4,Really yummy and easy.  Although I find that it takes much longer to cook than the recipe indicates.
8/25/2010,4,Pretty easy to put together and fed 10 people with none to spare.
1/1/2010,4,This recipe couldn't have been easier and it was delicious!  I rated it 4 out of 5 stars because I think it could use a little zip.  As is it is typical scrambled eggs only easier so if your f...
11/11/2009,4,These were really good.  I used half and half instead of milk because I had it.  I scaled down the recipe to test before I serve them on Thanksgiving morning.  20 minutes was perfect in my oven....
12/13/2008,4,just be sure and check your eggs periodically. the first time i halved the eggs and used an 8x8 dish and it took longer than suggested. the second time also halved ther recipe and used a 1.5...
9/15/2008,4,I would not add any salt to mine next time.  But it turned out great!
7/7/2008,4,1/4 c butter would have been enough.  The texture is much lighter and more airy than normal scramble eggs.  Use less milk for a firmer scrambled egg.
7/4/2008,4,I thought these were absolutely WONDERFUL - light fluffy and VERY tasty. Great for a crowd but be forewarned that doubling or tripling the recipe also doubles or triples the cooking time.  AN...
3/8/2008,4,"I added smoked Gouda cheese and red onion yum yum!
*TIP* preheat oven then put the butter & pan in the oven to melt the butter while you mix the eggs. saves cleaning an extra dish*"
3/1/2008,4,Very easy and turned out nice and fluufy as described.  Makes a huge dish of eggs.  We added some cheeses and other omlet type stuff and everyone said it was a winner.
12/27/2007,4,Had these on Christmas morning for brunch with all the other items I had to make it was great to just throw it in the oven.  I didn't use the butter I just sprayed the casserole dish with Pam...
8/25/2007,4,Too much butter and not enough salt. I had to pour the melted butter from the top of the eggs after cooking. I will make this again for the convenience but use half or a quarter of the butter a...
7/24/2007,4,Excellent recipe!  I scaled it down to 3 servings for myself and 2 kids added handsfulls of cheddar cheese and a bunch of diced ham leftover from the ham I baked last night tossed in a little ...
4/23/2007,4,These were great and a very easy way to feed a crowd. I cut down the milk a bit and sprayed my pan with cooking spray eliminating the butter altogether.
3/4/2007,4,This dish is similar to one my mother-in-law makes using cornflakes and sausage.  This was really simple and turned out good.  However I did make some adjustments.  I was only cooking for two so...
11/27/2006,4,Very good. I added bacon and onions. I will probably not add onions the next time I make it.
10/23/2006,4,These eggs were a big hit - fluffy and tasty. They did take about 5 minutes longer to bake than the recipe states. I added the cheese on half of the eggs and that turned out great. One big note:...
6/12/2006,4,This was a hit with our family.  It was very easy to make and the timing was fine.  Next time I will reduce the amount of salt.  The eggs were a little salty for my taste.
3/8/2006,4,I used a non stick pan and no butter. Just sprayed with butter flavored PAM. Used  Southwest flavored Eggbeaters and added some cheese. Made this for my lunch today and it was so good. Thanks!
1/24/2006,4,As far as scrambled eggs go these were great!  They could definitely stand to be made more interesting with breakfast meats vegetables etc.
12/31/2005,4,This is how we used to make eggs for our sorority when there were 75 or so of us eating breakfast. We used the large 10x14 disposable pans. You can customize this as you see fit. Thank you.
1/17/2005,4,this is a very good start to an awesome dish. just add whatever you would like into this recipe (hambaconcheese) and it turns out great. thanks erin!!
11/6/2003,4,I'm rating this based on method alone.  I used my own scrambled egg recipe (2T OF SOUR CREAM FOR EVERY TWO EGGS AND 1/4 TSP. CORNSTARCH FOR EACH EGG) but I still added the butter.  My eggs took ...
5/4/2003,4,These eggs were very fluffy but they took about 25 minutes to cook. They ended up being very saltymaybe because I used salted butter in the recipe? Next time I'll use unsalted butter and seaso...
3/24/2003,4,These eggs were light and fluffy and EASY!  I only made half the recipe and baked it in an 8x8 baking dish.  Stirred it several times so mine came out more like scrambled eggs but fluffier than ...
2/23/2003,4,These were easy and a big hit with my people! You may want to add some mushrooms and tomato to spruce it up.
1/1/2003,4,This makes perfect scrambled eggs soft and fluffy but thoroughly cooked and it is so much easier than standing over the stove making them.  I halved the recipe since it is just my husband and...
4/6/2015,3,Tried these for Easter brunch thought how easy is this to put in the oven and not have to watch over them if only it worked.  After 45 minutes the eggs were still totally liquid and I had used...
10/17/2014,3,These took a bit more babysitting than I'd hoped and longer to et up adequately.
10/7/2014,3,These were just okay. I can see where this would be good if serving a large crowd.be sure to SPRAY your pan with Pam as it took me forever to clean my dish... Even after soaking overnight
9/18/2014,3,Well I make it in a smaller batch when i just wanna make eggs for the family. I use garlic and onion powder some shredded cheese and milk into the scrampled eggs bake until I feel they're don...
3/26/2014,3,I thought the eggs were too salty and wet. Otherwise ok. I'll decrease the salt and milk next time.
6/30/2013,3,It didn't turn out like I was expecting I ended up cooking quite a bit longer than 20-25 mins & that was w/ recipe halved but still in 9x13 pan....??? I think the milk was too much in my batch...
11/4/2012,3,Very good eggs. Cooked as expected. I would decrease the amount of milk in the mixture as the eggs came out a little too fluffy. -1 star for me on that point. -1 for cook time as well. I could d...
3/12/2012,3,Excellent!  Light and fluffy and oh so very easy.  I put the eggs in my stand mixer with the salt (reduced to 1 tsp) and freshly ground black pepper (a few turns of the pepper mill) and beat unt...
3/10/2012,3,I didn't really care for these eggs. It's a good recipe only if you need to make a large amount otherwise you can make better eggs on the stovetop.
3/4/2012,3,Good and easy but add some shredded cheese and fresh snipped chives and you really have something.
2/20/2012,3,They were edible but not light & fluffy - I can't imagine what I did wrong.  Do cut the butter down as I had to drain the butter off the top.  They did take longer to bake than directed.  Would ...
1/23/2011,3,I did not care for the flavor or the texture of these eggs.  I don't know that I've ever had re-hydrated eggs but this is what I imagine them to taste like.  Most of my guests did comment on how...
12/26/2009,3,Not as good as I was hoping. It took longer than stated to cook and was way to wet. It had way to much butter. I will stick to the frying pan. Thanks anyway.
12/21/2009,3,This was alright.  A good idea for making lots of scrambled eggs at one time but there was too much salt and too much butter.  I'd cut those way down if I make it again.
7/5/2009,3,It was definitely easier to cook these than regular scrambled eggs in a pan but they ended up waaay to salty based on the recipe. They weren't as flavorful as usual either...
9/29/2005,3,fluffs up nicely
3/31/2017,2,Halved this recipe and baked in 8x8. Took significantly longer than expected which was no big deal. However even after slightly reducing the halved amount of butter and salt these were way too...
2/22/2015,2,The eggs were great when they were finished.  I hade to crank it up to 425 and it still took 45 minutes!
5/18/2013,2,Eh. Still searching for a great Scrambled Egg recipe. Maybe this doesn't translate when you make it just for one. I divided everything by 8 to accomodate 3 eggs. Oh well.
4/9/2012,2,This recipes calls for a ridiculous amount of butter and salt.  I used about 1/3 cup of butter and 2 teaspoons of salt and it was still too much.  Next time I would use about 2 Tablespoons of bu...
3/4/2012,2,Ok but not a patch on my scrambled eggs made in small amounts in a microwave.
6/15/2016,1,I made these for bible study and everyone loved them! I added crumbled breakfast sausage and stirred half way thru baking afterwards I stirred in shredded cheddar cheese and they were awesome! ...
1/10/2015,1,Like some others I struggled with this one. I scaled it down to just 4 servings and had it in the oven for over an hour but the eggs still didn't set. I finally got frustrated and finished it i...
1/20/2013,1,hmmm...not for me. ..they should be cooked very lightly and be almost set....there should still be some almost custard soft eggs...its like the difference between fried rice and risotto...one fi...
5/28/2012,1,At our Bed and Breakfast here in WV I tried this recipe. After 10min the egg mixture hadn't even started to cook.15min added not any better.  I followed the recipe I am not sure why it didn't ...
5/1/2012,1,I didn't like this at all and neither did my family.
3/5/2012,1,These eggs were not what I was expecting at all. They were really wet and mushy and their texture was overall hard to choke down. We had to have toast just for some different texture.
3/18/2011,1,These were a complete failure!  They were NOT cooked in 25 minutes but completly raw and liquidy!  I had to turn the heat up to 500 and then try to scramble them in the hot oven without burning...
5/11/2007,1,"I didn't care for these at all. It was probably (seeing as everyone gave these eggs such a high rating) something I did.

8/25/2014,5,Very easy reciepe to follow. I was told to soak the shark steaks in butter milk instead of regular milk; not sure if that really matters. Shark is an acquired taste in my opinion. You either lov...
7/4/2014,5,It's a great basic recipe can never go wrong with this when you've got shark! Allow me to clear some misconceptions about it. The Milk is there to help rid the meat of any fishy smell / ammonia...

9/17/2011,5,For those questioning the use of milk I didn't use it I just washed the steaks under cool running water for a few minutes and then squeezed lime juice over them. And if you don't get a good c...
9/7/2011,5,I will be trying this tonight but just wanted to clarify that the milk is to remove any fishy odor and/or taste.
1/6/2010,5,This was very good and very simple.  I was skeptical about the milk at first but it worked out well.  My family enjoyed it.
10/28/2008,5,I have never cooked shark before & this was a great simple recipe. It smelled sooo good when it hit the grill. Will definitely be making this again.
9/19/2008,5,Very delicious but also very spicy if you don't scrape off some of the seasoning before eating!
6/13/2015,4,Milk isn't really needed - cut the small black 'eye' out of the shark steak (same with swordfish) and all the fishy taste goes in the garbage not into the meat!
3/30/2012,4,Just to clarify any and all misunderstandings about soaking shark in Milk. Shark meat has a strong ammonia type smell when harvested. Soaking in milk will remove that smell and taste. The way I ...

3/8/2011,4,This is a quick and simple recipe that can easily be complimented with other spices to fit your taste. Soaking in milk may sound strange but it gets rid of the ammonia taste that sharks sometime...
5/20/2008,4,I've never marinated anything in milk but my guess is that is helped keep the fish moist...it was very good
5/10/2008,4,Thank you -- neat to try.
8/18/2011,3,Recipe may be good. But I may just not care for shark. My bf and I both couldn't eat it. Very dry and strange flavor.
9/13/2009,1,I am not sure if it was the cut of fish it was not good.
6/15/2017,5,"Tastes great!  Perfect for high protein lower carbs & fat diets.
I sprayed a fine mist of avocado oil instead of butter spray. Avocado oil has a much higher smoke temp than other oils."

1/26/2016,5,I did not need to make any changed to this recipe. It was very flavorful. I will save this to my favorites for sure!
12/14/2015,5,I have made this twice but with some substitutions! I'm not a fan of mackerel so I just used the tuna. I also didn't have Mrs. Dash so I used a dash of onion powder and garlic powder a pinch ...
11/18/2015,5,I have to make this one
8/15/2015,5,Put on a white corn tortilla with fresh veggies and balsamic vinegar glaze. Delicious!
3/7/2015,5,Really delicious and easy to make.
1/8/2015,5,These are very very tasty.  I didn't have pork rinds so I added a little coconut flour.  The seasoning is perfect.  Mine were crumbly but that might be because I used coconut flour.
7/21/2014,5,An awesome low carb twist and very tasty!

Made for Super Bowl party.
Made at home packed in  tupperware layers separated by wax paper.  
Will make again.
Next time put on crackers..."
1/22/2014,4,yes i liked it
4/22/2014,2,Not a hit-took to a party and no one ate any-
11/8/2017,5,I used old cinnamon rolls instead of bread. It reminded me of what my grandmother used to make when i was little. Turned out perfectly a little crusty on top and custardy on the bottom.
11/4/2017,5,Excellent recipe and easy to follow.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.
10/14/2017,5,I made this today and it is just like the one I grew up on and exactly like my Mom's recipe! I was looking everywhere for a custardy recipe and this one truly lives up to it! The custard is thic...
10/12/2017,5,I have made this twice a month for more than 6 months. It’s the best recipe I have found. Any bread donut bagel even Madeline cookie/cakes have gone in it. Never has failed!

9/10/2017,5,Came out perfect!!
6/6/2017,5,We loved it made it with home made brioche bread that I made in my bread machine ad served it with warm rum sauce  delicious!!!!!
4/30/2017,5,I used raisen bread and I didn't have half & half so I substituted 2 cans evaporated milk & 1 cup lowfat milk. The best bread pudding I have ever tasted. My husband ate 1/2 of it the 1st night h...
3/12/2017,5,My family loved this pudding!  Next time I will make it half sweet and try 2% milk (I used 5%).  We found it a bit sweet and hubby doesn't  need the calories:)    WINNER!
2/15/2017,5,Awesome recipe for the best custard. You decide how much and what kind of bread to use. Best bread pudding since my gramma's!!!
1/28/2017,5,I made this but used half the sugar and 8 slices of bread everyone loved it and want the recipe
1/28/2017,5,Made this exactly as described and it was great!
1/26/2017,5,Super simple.  The ingredients are easy to remember  and the finished dish is fantastic.  Thanks for the recipe!

10/23/2016,5,It was delicious!! I Used a pint and a quarter of half & half instead of quart. Used 6 leftover canned Grands Style biscuits instead of bread. Perfect tweak.

8/22/2016,5,The bread absorbed most of the liquid making it very  moist and delicious! There was no layer of custard though. Most bread puddings I've made come out more dry but not this one. I halved it a...

5/27/2017,5,BEST tiramisu recipe. I would say it's for intermediate bakers since you kind of have to know what textures to look for. I put some chocolate milk into the coffee and that was a total hit!

7/31/2017,5,This was a great recipe.  I quartered  it since ceviche  is better on the first day. I diced the shrimp  and they pinked up just fine. If you poach them it isn't really ceviche.

2/2/2009,5,This is a wonderful BASE recipe- I adjusted the amount of shrimp. I used about 1 1/2# shrimp and 1/2# bay scallops.  The lemon and lime juice should also cover the seafood for at least an hour b...
10/16/2008,5,I have had ceviche in Mexico & this is pretty close in taste. I like it best with shrimp & a good white fish. I also added radishes. It is good with scallops though. I like to eat it as a dip wi...
5/1/2008,5,turned out perfect and tasted great! It's a recipe you can easily customize to your own taste too!
4/3/2008,5,It was really good but I didn't add the oil because I don't like the taste of oil in something you eat cold and I had to add extra lime juice. Overall still 5 stars
3/15/2008,5,This is great my first attempt at Ceviche.  I used real crab med shrimp and white fish. I will make it again!!
1/14/2008,5,Scaled down and only used shrimp but this is a great foundation recipe for ceviche.  Certainly as enjoyable as ceviche we've had at quality restaurants.
1/7/2008,5,I really enjoyed this recipe! I will make this again. I would like to mention that this recipe made more than my family and guests could eat. Huge servings!
12/28/2007,5,Mmmmm... this was excellent!  I didn't even add the salt pepper or olive oil and it was fabulous!
9/15/2007,5,Refreshing light summer dinner ... my hubby LOVED it
9/13/2007,5,I made this for a potluck sort of affair and it was well-received. I used one lb shrimp one lb scallops and one lb haddock loins (I'm a poor college kid I can't afford $50 worth of fish) bu...
8/23/2007,5,My youngest son LOVES ceviche and I made this this week-end I also added avocado just before serving. I added some crab meat with the shimp (med. shimp so I cut them in half) and served with bu...
8/6/2007,5,Great recipe - the only changes i made was to add avocado and clamato juice.  the whole family loves this recipe and requests it all the time.

5/16/2005,5,This is a great recipe for those summertime picnics/BBQ's. I made it this past weekend and everyone could not stop raving about it!!! I highly recommend this treat!!
2/18/2014,4,Made this tonight and it turned out well. I found that this needed more lemon/lime in order to cook and as some other reviews have mentioned it needed quite a bit longer before it was done.
11/18/2012,4,I made this tonight for the 5th time and it is so delicious! Few changes from the directions I made were: Marinating the bay scallops alone for about 5 hours. When I have made this previously I...

4/5/2010,4,Very good.  Since I was short on time I didn't want to wait for shrimp to cook in lime. I dunked the seafood in boiling water for 10 seconds prior to cutting. Pretty good ceviche. I was told le...

12/14/2009,4,This wasn't bad.  My neighbors recipe is a little better.  I did add some avacado for another added texture and flavor...all in all it was decent and easy enough to make.
9/4/2009,4,I love this....I make it without seafood as well just to have a light dinner. I serve all the veggies on a tostada (hard fried corn tortilla). I also add a few TBLS of clamato rather than olive ...
9/4/2009,4,4 stars for the taste ! This is a seafood cocktail not ceviche. Ceviche you grind up or chop up real fine let it marinate for 24 hours or so. Had the right ingredients.
7/26/2009,4,I made this for a big party and it was a complete hit. I left out the scallops and made 1/4 of the recipe. I like my ceviche a little sweet  so I added 3 tablespoons of ketchup and a pinch of P...

4/5/2009,4,A keeper. Very good ceviche recipe. I did add chunks of fish to this and hot sauce which added a nice kick! I love ceviche. Thanks.
2/2/2009,4,Delicious & easy to make but the marinating time was way off; after 5+ hrs my 2 lbs of shrimp & scallop combined had to be brought up to cooked on the stovetop.

8/25/2011,2,Next time I will either use bay shrimp or pre cooked shrimp. Takes a lot longer than an hour for the shrimp to cook. Very frusterating.

2/13/2009,5,This was very good.  I do have to warn that it has a very strong coffee taste.  It is not for those wanting a slight coffee flavor.  Other than this it is terrific.

9/26/2002,5,Awesome! I substitued 1/2 c. super-strong coffee for the 1/4 c. of hot water and 1/4 c. coffee liqueur in the cheesecake portion. I simply added the 2 tsp. of instant coffee to the strong brewed...

2/6/2002,5,This is AWESOME.  If you like cheesecake and chocolate this is the recipe for you.  It does take some time to make but well worth the effort.
9/25/2001,5,Very good cheesecake. I had to substitute very strong coffee for the coffee flavored liquor. It didn't have a strong flavor but we still enjoyed this cheesecake. I'll make it again for sure.
8/16/2001,5,This is delicious although I do prefer a stronger coffee taste.  I will definately make this again... got rave reviews!
7/23/2001,5,"This was a yummmy recipe everyone loved it...I used a little less cream cheese than suggested. We tried it with Jamoca flavored ice cream

9/21/2000,5,This is a good cheesecake not a very sweet one but very good for an after dinner dessert or for a brunch.
8/31/2000,5,This is an excellent great tasting cheesecake.  I have had numerous requests to make this cheesecake over and over again.
4/17/2015,4,I didn't have coffee liqueur.  Instead I used strong coffee.  I should have added something to increase the sweetness.  It was still a creamy and tasty cheesecake which the coffee and dark cho...
7/2/2014,4,Great recipe but I think next time I would cut the chocolate and sour cream down a bit and put a little more coffee. At least for my taste its too much chocolate.
3/26/2014,4,Everyone really liked this cheesecake.  I made a couple small changes I used chocolate chips (probably 10 oz) instead of the squares and I didn't use any whipping cream.  I also used 4 tsp of i...
1/24/2014,4,Excellent cheesecake. My niece wanted something for her 19th birthday with chocolate and this worked great. I replaced the topping with a ganache recipe found on the site. Only 2 changes I woul...
4/21/2013,4,Having made many many cheesecakes in the past I have ALWAYS made mine in the food processor with the steel blade. This guarantees a perfectly smooth consistent texture. Always use expresso powd...
11/13/2012,4,I had to make a number of changes but it still turned out quite well. I used ricotta cheese mixed with sour cream as I live in France and cream cheese is not available. I also didn't have any c...
4/22/2012,4,Got rave reviews from the coworkers but a bit heavy/rich for my taste. One slice will really do you. My chocoholic coworkers went nuts for it though.
4/8/2012,4,Oh my was this rich! This was well loved by all that I served it too. Rating it 4 stars b/c I thought the coffee flavor was pretty much absent. Very good recipe would add more coffee or use str...
3/29/2012,4,very rich and sweet almost too much
12/10/2011,4,I thought this was very good. It turned out a little gooier than I expected. Not as firm as other cheesecakes I have made. However the flavor was wonderful. I didn't have good luck with the cru...
12/4/2011,4,This was delicious. I didn't add the cream to the melted chocolate and it turned out fine. I used crushed oreos for the crust and added extra espresso like others suggested. Then I used a ganach...
11/26/2011,4,This cheesecake was very good and fairly simple to make.  I ended up cutting the chocolate in half so that it would feature more of the coffee flavor.  My crust was pretty moist but that could ...
9/4/2011,4,This turned out to be very good and beautiful to look at however I had an issue with the chocolate thickening too much after adding the cream. It was fine before I added it. If I make this aga...
4/30/2011,4,Great recipe quite impressive!  I doubled the crust to make it come halfway up the edges of the pan
2/12/2011,4,This was good but not as great as I was expecting based on the reviews. We found that there really wasn't much of a coffee or Kahlua taste. It was also a bit less firm than we generally like for...
1/23/2011,4,The cake was indeed sinful but was way too soft. Needed to be firmer and I chilled for 24 hours before eating. Almost impossible to serve just collasped. Delicious though! I used oreo cookies a...
1/9/2011,4,This had a great flavor and texture however it was a little too sweet for everyone.  I especially loved the cinnamon in the crust.  No one else seemed to notice but I did and I LOVED it!  One do...
12/27/2010,4,I was slightly disappointed in this although it was very tasty.  The filling was very good - smooth and delicious.  The whipped cream on top was wonderful.  But the crust?  It was just ok.  It ...
7/26/2010,4,While it was two rich for my taste the rest of my family loved it and requested it again! I had no trouble with the melting of the chocolate and such but I had never done it before so I tag t...
4/18/2010,4,This was pretty good. I wasn't keen on the flavor that much and the texture wasn't as good as I had hoped but everyone liked it well enough.
12/26/2009,4,I would recommend a cup and a half of crushed cookies. That way the crust comes out a little thicker and it is easier to spread. Otherwise wonderful recipe. So delicious!
12/8/2009,4,I'm a chocolate fan but this cheesecake was a tad too rich for even me!  Could have possible used more cooking time as the center didn't firm as much as it should have.
11/26/2009,4,I made this cheesecake in mini form using one chocolate wafer from an Oreo cookie as the bottom crust.  There was a strong tang from the sour cream that I didn't care for.  The chocolate wasn't ...
9/15/2009,4,I made my own coffee liquer using a recipe from this site - and I thought the cheesecake turned out good. It actually tasted a lot like the cappuccino bon-bons my Mom used to make. My only sore ...
4/3/2009,4,I followed the directions to a T but my cheesecake cracked and just fell apart when trying to slice. Probably not the recipe's fault I've just never made cheesecake before.
3/24/2009,4,I made adjustments because I don' like coffee.  Instead of the instant coffee I used raspberry flavord instant hot cocoa mix.  Instead of the coffee liquour I used Chambord. I didn't double the ...
3/9/2009,4,Rich elegant and delicious. I gave it four stars instead of five since the texture was pretty grainy. I think it may have been the chocolate. Next time I'll melt it alone and add the whipping c...
1/12/2009,4,I like to make several desserts for Christmas dinner and one is always a cheesecake. This is a nice recipe that presents well and isn't too heavy. I liked the cinnamon in the crust and the flavo...
12/12/2008,4,I thought this cheesecake was really delicious and full of flavor but nothing extraordinary.  In my opinion the crust was a little thin therefore if I did make it again I would double tha...
10/14/2008,4,A bit more chocolately then I like but other than that really good.
10/5/2008,4,I made it with 2 shots of espresso (1 for the filling and 1 for the whipped cream) instead of the instant coffee and coffee liqueur. I also used 1.5 of the crust. Consistency and presentation w...
6/19/2008,4,The taste of this cheesecake turned out amazing! However I had to bake it a lot longer than the recipe said and it was still soft in the middle when we ate it. Also all the cookie crumb crust ...
3/3/2008,4,This recipe was great and easy. Instead of making the crust myself i bought a pre made oreo cookie crust. Since the pie crust was small this recipe made two cheesecakes.  I added cappucino inste...
4/6/2007,4,looks good and i had no problem with the process.  for those who had trouble with the chocolate seizing you might try omitting the 2T whipping cream.  worked fine that way.  i gave four stars b...
12/4/2006,4,A bit strong in coffee flavor for  me..next time I may try decreasing the instant coffee a bit...or adding some cocoa powder in to offset it..over all pretty good though.
12/10/2005,4,I am new at making cheesecakes.  Thought I would try my hand at the Chocolate Cappuccino cheesecake.  It tasted good but I noticed it was crumbly when cut.  Also the top had some crackes in it. ...

12/1/2002,4,The flavor of this cheesecake was delicious however I don't know what I did wrong but it was a little too soft and didn't slice easily.  I baked it a litle longer because it just didn't seem t...
11/25/2002,4,I could only rate this a 4 because my chocolate kept siezing.  I must have done something wrong with it but I tried it three times.  I melted 8 oz. semi sweet chocolate and 2 tbsp. whipping cre...
7/23/2002,4,Taste is delicious!  I only wish someone would re-do this recipe with 2/3 less fat and calories!!!  I only make this for others!  Not for myself.
10/17/2001,4,Very smooth and creamy.  It took a lot of ingredients to make but everyone that tasted it loved it.  Good romantic recipe.
7/13/2014,3,This cheesecake tasted great but it was too rich and chocolatyand gave me a coffee perk every time I took a slice.

12/30/2007,3,The alcohol cooking off gave it a strange after taste.  Still edible and good but no where near great in the world of cheesecakes.

3/11/2005,3,The cake tasted wonderful but completely fell apart when I tried to get it off the springform bottom.  I had followed the directions exactly so I guess it needed to bake longer.  What a disapp...
7/4/2001,3,The cheesecake is so rich although it didn't come out as good as I expected.  Maybe because I omitted the coffee liquer which wasn't available at the time I made it.
3/21/2013,2,I hate to downgrade a recipe that most respondents have loved.  Have not the foggiest idea what went awry but it was not smooth and in fact was somewhat granular.  I've made plenty of cheeseca...

10/29/2003,5,This cake freezes very well.  No one will know you made it in advance.
9/20/2003,5,I made this for a baby shower and it was a huge hit.  I cooked in a bundt pan and it fell a little but I just sprinkled with powered sugar.  I cut the oil to 3/4 cup and it was still extremely ...

4/19/2000,5,I made this for my family and they loved it!  My mom could not stop raving about how delicious it was.  Neither could my boyfriend!  It's really great.  The only problem was that the mix was ...
2/13/2017,4,In what way can cake be too sugary? The brown sugar and walnut mix is essentially a frosting. Delicious without any changes to the recipe. I will definitely make this cake again.
9/18/2016,4,I made this cake with A Duncan Hines French Vanilla cake mix one vanilla pudding and one butterscotch pudding.  1/2 cup Applesauce and 1/2 cup olive oil.  No nuts.  A wee bit heavier crumb but...

10/22/2015,4,I love making this cake on birthdays topped with a light whipped cream cheese icing. It is delicious and well loved in my family! The only reason I didn't give it a full five stars is because fo...
10/10/2015,4,I liked this and the women's group at my church liked it but my husband didn't care for it.  It needed just a bit more cooking time.  I used cheesecake and lemon pudding by accident and I thoug...
7/27/2015,4,Super delicious! The cake was delectably moist. The cinnamon and brown sugar flavors compliment the vanilla and butterscotch flavors very nicely. My only issue was that the batter was very thick...
12/28/2014,4,Good simple coffee cake. Followed the steps exactly.
6/23/2014,4,Very good! Very easy!  Followed the recipe exact except did not add the nuts.  I brought this in to work and everyone loved it.
5/4/2014,4,I made it in a bundt pan and sprinkled some of the sugar mix on the bottom for some crunch and used two butterscotch pudding instead of one and one drizzled a glaze of confectioners sugar ic...
2/11/2014,4,Sweet moist and tasty! I used a 'pudding in mix' cake box so I skipped the 2nd pudding (also didn't have 1 in the cabinet). Subbed 1/2 cup of cinnamon applesauce for 1/2 of the oil you would ...
2/2/2014,4,With a few changes this was fantastic!!! I used half melted butter and half coconut oil instead of the vegetable oil. The cake mix I had already had pudding in the mix so I added just one packag...
12/9/2013,4,Hoo boy is this sweet!  I used sugar-free pudding (one vanilla and one cheesecake) and Splenda Brown and it was still tooth-achingly sweet.  Next time I will leave out the pudding and just mak...
12/5/2013,4,Taste is phenomenal but the texture could be better.  I would make this again but I would definitely let it cook longer.  I baked at 325 in a convection oven for 40 minutes which should be ab...
11/26/2013,4,I tried this recipe and it was very sweet. I made some changes. I don't like butterscotch so I used one vanilla pudding and one cheesecake flavored pudding.  I used 1/2 cup of vegetable oil and...
7/8/2013,4,This is a very a good recipe.  I didn't use the butterscotch putting mix as we don't like it but I used the big box of instant vanilla.  I also tweaked it by adding 1/2 cup of mini chocolate ch...
6/30/2013,4,I used coconut cream pudding pecans instead of walnuts and added toasted coconut. It is SUPER sweet.
4/22/2013,4,This was really easy to make. I omitted the nuts and used french vanilla and cheesecake pudding. My husband thought it was great and wants me to make it often. Everyone liked it at church and t...
1/20/2013,4,Just made this and I loved it! It was so soft and fluffy on the inside and nice and crunchy on the outside! Definetly making again! The only complaint is that it was kinda difficult.
12/12/2012,4,I made this recipe as written and it came out delicious but a bit on the sweet side (and I am not a person who frequently complains of things being oversweet). I think all that brown sugar is t...
11/23/2012,4,The crew at the office loved this but I did add my own personal touches. I did need to bake it longer than suggested so make sure u check it before taking it out.
9/27/2012,4,very moist and tasty!
7/27/2012,4,This was delicious with good texture  but still had the yellow cake mix flavor making it more birthday- cake tasting instead of cinnamon and pastry tasting.  I made it for breakfast so maybe ...
7/21/2012,4,I made four coffee cakes today  this one was very easy.  I only had a small tast but it seam very good. It is more cake like then the rest.  The topping is really good and a lot of it.  I will ...
3/25/2012,4,Very easy and quick to make. The cake mix I used had pudding already in it and I added the 2 pkgs. of vanilla pudding and it came out nice and moist. It baked a Lot quick than the recipe said i...
4/29/2011,4,Great easy to make and doesn't fall apart like some of the cakes with filling inside.  I made this at 3am fo the royal wedding watching party.  Great hit.
3/21/2011,4,I made the recipe exactly it was good.. but it was missing a little something it wasnt a WOW recipe for me.
3/17/2011,4,i love how easy to make this coffee cake.. my family devour it the first time i made it. thank you so much for posting this recipe..
2/27/2011,4,Easy to make my daughter was able to help (6 yrs old) with it. I used a bundt pan and it took awhile to bake at least 1 hour. The end result after cooling in the pan for about 15 min. was very...
12/21/2010,4,Very sweet and simple.
9/11/2010,4,Pretty tasty.
8/7/2010,4,This  coffee cake is awesome! I made it because i wanted something sweet to eat and I took some into work with me and everyone absolutely loved it. However I am giving it 4 stars because the ba...
5/17/2010,4,I have made this cake twice 100% according to the recipe.  I have gotten very good feedback from my family but I think it would be slightly better if you used less oil.  I would recommend 1/4 cu...
3/30/2010,4,Not too bad.
3/28/2010,4,Loved this as did my whole family.  I wish I had taken the advice of others and replaced some of the oil with apple sauce or apple butter.  It was greasy to the touch (but oh so delicious).  Am...
3/8/2010,4,Used 1 pkg vanilla pudding and 1 pkg butterscotch - received mixed reviews from the family. It seems the butterscotch was too much. Will try again with 2 vanillas. Overall a great moist coffe...
3/2/2010,4,Made in a Bundt pan for a brunch and was a hit with coffee!
3/2/2010,4,have made this several times pretty much as is and it's always yummy!
1/31/2010,4,really good.
1/9/2010,4,When I tasted it the day it was baked it was awful...tasted like overspiced cake mix.  The flavor improves dramatically after 2 days.  I also skipped the brown sugar because I was worried about...
11/14/2009,4,This is a good recipe but it is alittle more like regular cake...I think I will do four layers next time as suggested by others. Other than that the inl-laws loved it for brunch. Also I may st...
9/16/2009,4,was really good my family loved it
9/8/2009,4,Delicious!! Very moist cake and sweet crunchy topping/filling. I baked this in a bundt pan and sprinkled some of the topping into the bottom of a well greased bundt. It stuck a little so grease...
8/14/2009,4,I made this cake to take to work.  It was really easy to make came out extremely moist and everyone liked it.  I didn't add nuts since I don't eat them.  There wasn't much flavor to the cake....
7/19/2009,4,Good coffee cake - but a little sugary for my taste. The brown sugar makes is more palatable but still I would cut back a bit for those who like subtle flavour more than in your face sweetness. ...
6/20/2009,4,This recipe is exceptional with a few minor changes. No butterscotch pudding and instead two packages of instant vanilla. Add more well chopped walnuts. Also three eggs worked better for me. Th...
5/17/2009,4,I never thought you could have the coffee cake flavor without the coffee but as I eat this cake I'm at least reminded of a coffee cake and I guess that's the idea.  I took another reviewer's s...
5/5/2009,4,quick and easy - it was good but I was expecting something greater I suppose because of all the high reviews. My Dad however LOVED this recipe and has asked for it several times since I made i...
4/17/2009,4,My husband and daughter loved this recipe. It was very moist but I might try changing the topping next time. I didn't care for the topping in this recipe but the cake part came out great.  It a...
3/4/2009,4,So delicious! I should say the topping is not the usual crumb-like cofee cake topping I was hoping for. I need to find a good crumb topping recipe. The cake itself is fabulous. I used 2 boxes of...
1/18/2009,4,I recommend this recipe because it is simple to make relatively fool-proof and has a nice delicate flavor.  It is moist as one would expect for a coffee cake.
9/8/2008,4,OK I definitely goofed making this cake but the portion that was cooked enough was very good and I am sure will be much better the next time I try it which will be very soon.  Opened the oven ...
7/8/2008,4,Super easy to make received rave reviews in the office! A great breakfast/dessert!
5/16/2008,4,This is a decent coffee cake but I didn't think it worked well in 9x13. The batter is super thick and doesn't spread well. I ended up swirling the cinnamon layer into the cake. It worked well. I...
2/28/2008,4,A little heavy for me. I took it to a church function and everyone liked it! I did just use two packages of vanilla pudding instead of adding the butterscotch. I'm not a fan of butterscotch. It ...
2/24/2008,4,I followed the recipe but substitued the butterscoth pudding for chocolate. My boyfriend brought it to work and everyone loved it.
2/23/2008,4,This cake was pretty good. I followed it exactly except for using a french vanilla cake mix & pecans instead of walnuts. I used a glass pan cooked the minimum time & the edges are overdone s...
2/11/2008,4,Good coffee cake and very easy to put together.  I substituted applesauce for 3/4 cup of the oil and reduced the brown sugar to about 3/4 cup.  I baked it in a bundt pan and did three layers of ...
2/5/2008,4,Very good! and very easy to make. I exchanged the walnuts for pecans.
1/10/2008,4,Very moist and tasty but the color was a little odd from the butterscotch pudding.
1/5/2008,4,This was too rich for my liking and that is after I read the reviews and toned it down a bit - I made it in a bunt pan and tried to put the brown sugar mixture on the bottom so it'd be on the ...
1/29/2007,4,I used a few substitutions on this recipe and it came out perfect. Instead of instant pudding mixes I used 1-4 oz cup of ready made vanilla pudding and 2 or 3-4 oz cups of ready made butterscotc...
1/12/2007,4,This recipe is very easy to make.  I used pumpkin spice pudding mix instead of butterscotch and it turned out great.  The recipe is too sweet though.  I would make it again but cut down on the s...
10/13/2006,4,Great recipe but the cooking time is a little low. Add 15 minutes to the stated cooking time for a bundt pan.
10/8/2006,4,This cake was a hit however next time I will add some pumkpin pie spice to the cake to jazz it up a bit.
9/23/2006,4,"this was just ok i was expecting more. it was a little bland. we enjoyed the brown sugar/walnut topping.
though tasting it the next day it was a lot better."
9/20/2006,4,I followed the recipe exactly (even though cake mix had pudding in it) except it needed to be cooked 20 minutes longer in a bundt pan. I also sprinkled powdered sugar on for visual appeal.  I a...
5/14/2006,4,I made this in a 10 in bundt. I liked it but it was not the best I have ever had. My family did enjoy it though!
2/5/2006,4,I thought it was a bit too sweet but the kids and husband loved it!  I reduced the eggspudding and oil to 2 eggs and 1/3 C. oil and 1 box of pudding.
2/4/2006,4,I thought it was a little to sweet.
1/29/2006,4,I used 2 eggs and 1/3 c of oil.  Still very moist!  After removing cake from stove it came out flat.  It was good.  Would make it again. Omitted walnuts.
1/19/2006,4,Absolutely wonderful for every occasion.  Morning afternoon and evening...a hit with every crowd even the kids!
12/20/2005,4,I also halved the oil and it came out perfect (with a little longer cooking time-50mins). The mother in law loved it.
10/12/2005,4,It was good but not the best.
2/24/2005,4,very moist almost too moist. i only used 3/4 cup of oil and 3/4 cup of brown sugar as other reviewers suggested. any more oil than this would have been WAY too much. i might even cut it down ne...
1/20/2005,4,I made this cake for my friend who's in-laws were visiting from the Dominican Republic. Pretty good. I made it in a bundt pan. A piece of the cake stuck to the pan when I was removing it so I du...
12/3/2004,4,I made this recipe exactly according to the instructions and it turned out very well.
5/16/2004,4,Pretty good and stays very moist for almost a week!
1/21/2004,4,This was okay. It didn't blow me away with flavor. It tasted like another box mix and I was hoping for more. I probably won't make it again.
1/10/2004,4,This was okay.  I didn't have enought brown sugar so I had to use a little reg. sugar so it didn't taste as sweet.  I might make it again
11/1/2003,4,Very moist and sweet.  It was well received.  I used cinnamon chips instead of walnuts which may have added to the sweetness.
11/18/2002,4,Since this cake adds 2 pkgs of pudding use a cake mix that does not already have pudding in the mix.  Duncan Hines is the only one I know of that doesn't have pudding added.
11/17/2002,4,I have made similar cakes like this before.  The butterscotch pudding does give it a darker color and adds a little bit compared to all vanilla.  When it says to pour half the cake mix in and th...
10/31/2002,4,Easy to make and very good.
10/27/2002,4,As far as ease goes this recipe was the best.  The butterscotch pudding gave the cake a good flavor as well as a very moist texture but the cake was just too sweet.  If I make it again It will...
6/12/2016,3,I made mine in a 9x13 pan and it came out looking like a flat very brown cake with a misshapen top. The streusel topping on mine didn't stay beautiful like you'd expect it would. Next time I'll...
2/2/2014,3,I followed the recipe exactly and found it way too sweet for my family's taste.  Also I expected it to be a rich moist cake but what I got was what seemed to be an under-baked consistency.  I...
7/27/2013,3,This recipe has way too much sugar. I used a cake mix with pudding so I only added the butterscotch pudding. Next time I will use half the sugar in the cinnamon mixture there was WAY to much. I...
3/17/2013,3,It was easy and turned out fine but wasn't quite what I was expecting.  It tasted good but I found it way too sweet.  More of a dense yellow cake with a lot of sugar and cinnamon than a traditi...
3/7/2013,3,Not really impressed for the reviews it had. Did follow directions with everything it had even using the butterscotch & vanilla flavors. Flavor was ok maybe instead of doing a layer in the mid...
11/14/2012,3,Everyone else loved I thought it tasted too much like yellow cake...Krustez box is better.
8/15/2012,3,Pretty good but mine came out kind of flat.  This was easy and had a great flavor though.  Thanks for sharing!
8/21/2011,3,Holy Moses this sucker is heavy. If you're looking for a light cake this aint it. It tastes ok but it's a  the thighs recipe and for that I want better than 'tastes ok'.
3/14/2011,3,This was good and easy to make but very sugary! I would cut some of the brown sugar
2/6/2011,3,My kids liked this a lot because it is sooooooooo sweet but it was not my favorite and because of all the boxed items in this recipe I felt it lacked that homemade goodness taste.
12/16/2010,3,Good recipe. Mine came out dense and moist. I made a sugarfree version and warmed sugarfree vanilla frosting as my icing drizzle. I'm pretty satisfied with how it turned out!
10/14/2010,3,I made this for breakfast but it tasted more like a birthday cake.  I'm not fond of box mix recipes but thought this one looked promising... but there are much better coffee cake recipes out th...
2/12/2010,3,More of a pound cake than coffee cake but still tasted great and was easy to throw together.
12/10/2009,3,Made these into muffins. Reduced topping and sprinkled on top of muffins. Cooked for twenty minutes. Not sure what the point is for the butterscotch pudding. Absolutely no butterscotch flavor ca...
10/18/2009,3,I have too many suggestions to improve this recipe according to the tastes of my family so it's difficult to give this a higher rating.  Certainly a good basic recipe.  The middle layer of sug...
6/24/2009,3,It was just okay... didn't have that much flavor... and I followed the recipe word for word!
6/22/2009,3,this was just ok  im going to try a few other recipes. I can say it was very moist.
3/10/2009,3,Ok..I made this Sunday Morning..it was a total flop..only one that would touch it was my 3yr old who will eat ANYTHING with cinnamon.  It just tasted...odd.  So it sat in the cake pan for 2 days...
1/19/2009,3,Too sweet
12/5/2008,3,This tasted good but it has a wierd spongey texture I think due to all the pudding. I prefer a dense moist cake not spongey.  I probably won't make this again.
9/22/2008,3,I decided to make it more difficult than it needed to be by trying cupcakes out of this. After a while of teaspoons of cake then crumble and so on finally got them in the oven starting at 350 f...
2/4/2008,3,This was good but it just tastes like yellow cake with a cinnamon brown sugar crust.  For this reason I wouldn't call this coffee cake. Just cake.
12/19/2007,3,This tasted alright. The top and corners got slightly too well done but the middle was perfect!
11/11/2007,3,I'm only giving this recipe three stars.  It was extremely easy and moist however It was just a little too sweet. I was also put off by the color.  Mine came out orange....I know that really d...
8/10/2007,3,This was edible but not great.  It was greasy and I used less oil as suggested by others.  The edges rose and were cakey but the middle was flat.
3/14/2007,3,Good recipe but very rich.  I reduced some of the oil this time and next time I will halve the sugar.
3/11/2007,3,This was good but not great.  It was too rich for our liking.
11/15/2005,3,This turned out to be a little bland. I think maybe a little more sugar was needed.My husband does not like really sweet things so he really liked this. Thank you.
8/25/2004,3,My husband and I thought this recipe was okay but not fabulous.  I used only 3/4 cup oil like someone else had suggested so maybe that made it a bit less tasty? It was very easy to make thoug...
5/25/2004,3,This recipe was just okay.  Everyone in my house ate a piece and enjoyed it okay at the time but none of us went back for seconds and the cake just ended up sitting there.  Not bad at all just n...
11/8/2003,3,ok made in bundt pan when you flip it most of the topping falls off. If you make in bundt pan maybe put some of the topping in the pan then batter etc.
7/30/2001,3,It was very moist. It had alittle more nuts and cinnimmon than I liked. I was looking for another similar recipe and found this one thinking it was it. It wasn't but it was good. I agree that ma...
9/7/2000,3,The cake in this coffee cake is simply delicious. For my taste the nut mixture was a bit sweet but I brought it to work and everybody loved it. I will definitely make this again but will cut th...
2/19/2013,2,I tried this recipe in a bundt pan and was very disappointed.  The center was mushy it seemed like it wasnt baked all the way so I left it in the oven for an extra 10 minutes.  The outside brow...
10/17/2010,2,Well....it was sweet. REAL sweet. But I suppose that was to be expected considering the ingredients.   I was trying to use up some things stocked in my pantry so I can start eating healthier. ...
10/1/2010,2,This was kind of bland and no better than what you can buy in the store.
12/18/2009,2,cake mix taste.  This is not home baking.
9/9/2009,2,This tasted like butterscotch cake instead of coffee cake. I would recommend using 2 vanilla pudding mixes.
4/17/2009,2,Not the best coffee cake I've ever had hoping it might be better in the days to come.
11/28/2008,2,very upset about this cake. followed the directions perfectly. baked it for 40 minutes. the toothpick test came out clean but there is apparently a ring of uncooked cake in the center of my bunt...
3/25/2008,2,I dont know what happened but when i mixed all the stuff up the batter was not batter it was actually like a dough even after i added more water vegetable oil and anohter egg.... and i could n...
1/27/2007,2,This was easy to make but we didn't care for it. The flavor was kind of off and the cake was dry. I followed the recipe as written and didn't change a thing.
9/21/2005,2,This did not have much flavor. It did not taste like a coffee cake. Was to moist. I think I will stick to store boght coffee cakes.
11/18/2003,2,This is only an average taste recipe.  I do not feel that this recipe rates a 5 star rating.  I will not make it again unless requested by my family.
2/22/2014,1,Too sweet.  Too heavy and dense.
3/3/2012,1,I did 1/2 applesauce and 1/2 oil.  the applesauce was natural- no sugar added but this cake was still way too sweet.  Even the kids that said they liked it only ate half their small slice. I th...
4/5/2011,1,I gave it a one star as it had good taste. However it did not taste anything like coffee cake nor did  it come out like the picture.  It was a strange gold color from the butterscotch pudding  ...
10/7/2010,1,I'm sorry maybe I just have a different taste than other people who rated this amazing. I followed the recipe exactly as it said and this cake did not turn out. I mean just the way it tasted w...
1/28/2009,1,Next time I'll find another recipe or  make MAJOR adjustments. Oily unappealing texture.
2/10/2008,1,Too greasy and heavy! And that's after cutting the oil to 1/2 cup and 1/2 cup applesauce. It tasted too much like butterscotch. We did not really like this cake.
2/18/2006,1,I don't know why everyone seemed to like this recipe so much because was very dense almost not like cake. Very very sweet and it fell apart when taking it out of the pan. It sounded good but ...
1/28/2006,1,I will NOT make this again.  With 2 boxes of pudding mix plus the brown sugar-nut mixture it was WAY too sweet.  This was a very dense heavy cake that didn't get very cake-y.
1/22/2003,1,This cake never seemed to get done! Left it in longer than recipe said to but still was underbaked.
9/4/2017,5,Made two batches both with added garlic clove. One with milder peppers one with 4 Serrano peppers and only my son really enjoyed that one.
8/22/2017,5,I made this to use up too many summer tomatoes and gave 2 jars to my daughter and son in law.  Got a text later that day Dude this salsa is so good!  We already ate a jar  I never get compli...

1/31/2015,5,I made sure to trim the ribs (white interior spines) of the pepper so it wouldn't be overwhelmingly spicy. I couldn't wait an hour and set on the salsa within 15 minutes. I also used diced grap...

6/6/2013,5,"I love this recipie- VERY good!

7/13/2012,5,This is so yummy I could make and then eat a whole batch by myself!  My tomato bushes went hog-wild this year so I've been looking for ways to use them and this is one of the best I've found. ...

6/13/2012,5,Delicious and easy!  As others suggested I added a clove of garlic and I skipped the cilantro because I generally dislike the flavor.  I got lots of compliments!

1/21/2012,5,I love this salsa the thing I did different was added some V8 spicy tomato juice.  Excellent touch!  I saw a few people added crushed garlic will have to try that next time.
12/30/2011,5,"Let me clear up some things first. 

Someone was complaining about how hot this salsa was and claiming that they eat Habaneros constantly. Habaneros are way hotter than Serrano chiles. This pe..."

8/1/2011,5,Simple and fresh! Always a winner in my book.
7/31/2011,5,really good... a super base. We de-seeded tomats & used the blender. many reviews recommend the addition of garlic but we found it didn't need that.

8/31/2010,5,This is a great recipe it reminds me of a traditional Mexican Pico de gallo. If you want it more saucy just add tomato sauce. Yummy- mine is 5 stars all the way.
8/28/2010,5,This is great.  Very fresh.  I love the onion and cilantro and it is a great way to use my many summer tomatoes.
8/26/2010,5,I did not have any serrano chilies on hand and subsituted 3 jalapeno peppers (de seeded) and it made a nice medium salsa. 3 peppers was spicy enough for our medium spicytastes.

8/13/2010,5,I prefer 1/2 a seeded habanero & that's spicy enough for me and use thinly sliced scallions instead of onion.  I also add a splash of orange juice to make this a Yucatan-type salsa.
8/10/2010,5,we can't even keep some for the next day. 2-3 chiles are good but its great without the chiles as well.

4/29/2010,5,I have been making salsa like this for years although I never measure what I put in I just use what's ready in the garden.  I do agree that 5 serranos are too many.  I usually use one jalapeno...

12/6/2009,5,I have made this several times and my husband and I both love it!!!

11/14/2009,5,I made this salsa for the first time last week and have already been requested to make it again this week.  I made some minor changes based on personal preference.  I use only 1 serrano chile (s...
11/11/2009,5,This recipe was so yummy!! It got eaten up so quickly I had to make more after two days!!  I definitly think it is best if you let it sit for at least a day for it to create a little more juice!!
11/7/2009,5,Delicious like the kind i get at el pollo loco. i didn't have any seranos but i don't take heat very well. i adjusted here and there more lime. Can't go wrong here.

9/13/2009,5,I have made this salsa over and over. We cannot get enough of it. My mother in law has even threaten me to save some for her when she visits in October. Guess I will have to freeze some for her....
9/12/2009,5,I love things hot but this calls for too many of the serrano chilies.  I just use one and it turns out great.
9/11/2009,5,I have never made salsa before.  Mainly because it seemed time consuming what with cooking the tomatoes and all.  This recipe is so easy and delicious!  I used some of the other suggestions and...
9/9/2009,5,YUMMMMMY!  I loved this recipe just the way it was -- except I didn't have serrano chilies but I had some homegrown Jalepeno's which worked just fine.  I only used 2 and that was super hot.  Ver...
9/8/2009,5,We changed it up a bit to suit what we had on hand but the end result was the best salsa I have ever had!  We ate about 4 batches of it one day and canned it the next.  I haven't tried it can...

9/5/2009,5,Excellent salsa recipe! Much much better than a store bought salsa.
9/2/2009,5,This salsa is so good but it's even better the second day. After the flavors in the salsa have had a chance to marinate the peppers become more mellow and the lime becomes more noticeable. I cu...
9/2/2009,5,In Mexico they add water to chopped salsa like this recipe. It's quite unique and adds a refreshing and delicious liquid to the salsa. Can also add cumin or celery salt.
9/1/2009,5,Excellent salsa.  I make it all the time.
9/1/2009,5,Great call using serrano peppers instead of jalapeno: they are hotter but have a distinctive taste. Please do remove seeds and ribs. If unsure as to hotness reserve some for adding later. Learn...
9/1/2009,5,I make this in my Vita Mix only I use one jalapeno pepper and lemon juice not lime. We have this over a crock pot of pinto beans that have been cooking all day. Delicious when scooped up with ...
9/1/2009,5,I've been making a variation of this recipe for a couple of years now.  I received the original recipe from my friend whose mother in law is spanish.  I add garlic and a little bit of diced gree...

8/31/2009,5,Great recipe - I added some chopped garlic and used one chopped Jalapeno in place of the Serranos.  My two girls gobbled this up!
8/30/2009,5,Take the other reviewer's advice and cut the Serrano peppers back to two!  Five is insane.  Two was plenty hot for us and my hubby likes his salsa spicy.  I also added one chopped clove garlic. ...
8/28/2009,5,Excellent and easy. I also added 2 cloves of garlic. I didn't have any serrano chilies so I added one red cherry pepper chopped up and included the seeds to give it a kick. It's still not too sp...

8/28/2009,5,This was soooo good and fresh. I used 3 tomatoes from a garden 3 serrano chiles left the membranes in one of them and lemon juice because I didn't have lime but followed recipe otherwise. Will ...
8/27/2009,5,I used 2 fresno chili peppers instead of serranos and it was too mild no heat even after refrigerating overnight. It was still very good.
8/27/2009,5,OMG...this salsa is awesome.  My husband and I love this recipe.  I used 2 jalapeno peppers instead of the chilies and I put the tomatoes in the blender before I added the rest of the ingredien...
8/24/2009,5,We really like this salsa; it's very flavorful!  We just thought that there was a bit too much salt; we'd use less next time.  We only used one pepper but otherwise we followed the directions.
8/23/2009,5,This was so good.  I used jalapenos (half a one for mild/medium and 1.5 for spicier folks).  My husband is from Peru and he loved this salsa!  I did too.  Fresh tomatoes a must.  I will never ...
8/22/2009,5,Great recipe! I used one jalapeno instead of serranos because that's what I had and to keep the heat level down. But this salsa has great flavors!
8/22/2009,5,This is the best fresh salsa recipe I've ever used.  I add garlic garlic scapes green onions scallions...whatever I have.  I love to use multi-colored tomatoes and red onion.  It looks as gre...
8/21/2009,5,I was taught to make this as pico de gallo also.  I use green salad onions a whole bundle (like it comes in the grocery store) of cilantro leaves only and 5 serranos and 5 jalapenos.  I use a ...
8/20/2009,5,GREAT as a marinade. I've been making this for years w/ jalapenos or habaneros.  One of the best uses other than as a pico de gallo chip dip/salsa is as a marinade for either chicken or shrimp...
8/19/2009,5,Followed the recipe exactly - came out yummmm. The chilli was perhaps one too much so I increased all ingredients a little :)  Also added a very little bit of sugar for a sweetish tinge which I...
8/19/2009,5,Everyone loved this salsa and asked for for the recipe
8/18/2009,5,Fantastic salsa!  I used crushed chiles to taste in order to keep it mild.  It was a great way to use my extra garden tomatoes.  Thank you bluebayou for sharing!
8/18/2009,5,I made this for lunch today. I didn't have serrano chile's and I only had 3 jalapeno's. I do think the flavor would've been better with the serrano's. We don't use much salt so the salt was a ...
8/18/2009,5,Wonderful!  The first time I ever made salsa was last week using this recipe but making 6 servings.  I made some adjustments like less onion and less pepper.  Very good!  Everyone loved it.  The...

7/27/2009,5,My husband and I love his salsa!  We grow the ingredients ourselves. You can't get fresher than that!  We like it hot!  The chilis is what attracted me to the recipe. In fact I added 7 chilis. ...
7/26/2009,5,Excellent I added only one pepper with the seeds and that was a little hot for me.  I also added one clove of garlic.
7/14/2009,5,Great salsa! I only put 3 serrano peppers without seeds.  5 serrano peppers would be way to hot for the average person.  I also added 1/2 t sugar to make it have a sweet taste.
7/11/2009,5,Love recipe - added 2-3 cloves of garlic and it is by far the best.

6/3/2009,5,I could not for the life of my find seranno chile's at Krogers so picked up a large jalapeno instead.  I used 4 roma tomatoes instead of 3 since they were on the smaller side.  Also I added 2...

5/24/2009,5,MUST HAVE GARLIC then it's the perfect salsa. Also I put all in a blender so I don't have to do as much chopping. I only added 2-3 peppers with seeds but we like it REALLY hot. I think 5 woul...
5/22/2009,5,I know some of the other reviewers said there was to much liquid in the bowl with this salsa I have found that if you seed the tomatoes it will cut down on the liquid quite a bit.  Otherwise th...
5/19/2009,5,Was very good even without the peppers!!
5/14/2009,5,I very rarely review a recipe even if we love it...I never think I'll have anything to add to what others have said before me.  However because I have made this one every weekend for the past ...
5/10/2009,5,Okay this should be called Pico de Gallo but it's awesome. I shied away from the 5 chiles but with only 2 it was pretty tame. That being said it was gone in minutes. This is super healthy an...
5/7/2009,5,Have been making this for years.  Simple but delicious.  Adjust type and amount of peppers based on the level of heat you can take.  I often put this on top of my salads instead of using dressin...

5/5/2009,5,Perfect fresh salsa recipe. I will make this again and again!
5/5/2009,5,This is a recipe known to me as pico de gallo. I use less serrano (2-3 depending on size...or even 1 large one adjust to taste). Serranos tend to be very small. Also use roma tomatoes for less...

4/21/2009,5,very very good. 5 peppers is WAY TO MUCH for us so we only used one. It's still quite spicy even with one pepper so taste around before adding more.
4/14/2009,5,A fresh tasty far superior alternative to store-bought!  You'll just need to experiment with the number of peppers/seeds that's right for you!  Our magic number: 5 peppers but the seeds from ...
3/26/2009,5,was good but spicy
3/17/2009,5,My husband has acid reflux so we used about 1/2 of a pepper and added a little cumin and red pepper paste. It was definitely spicy enough for our mild taste buds! Thanks for a wonderful recipe.....
3/8/2009,5,I needed a recipe to test my new electric mini chopper and this was perfect. I don't think we get serrano peppers here in the UK so I just used 1 big green one with the seeds taken out and it...
2/1/2009,5,I put 1 1/2 of the tomatoes in a food processer and diced remaining. I switched to jalapeno peppers instead. It was great. Very fresh tasting!
1/30/2009,5,This salsa is the greatest but I also added a chopped fresh parsley green pepper & garlic.  If you use the Vidalia Chop Wizard it takes no time at all to make.
1/6/2009,5,Excellent salsa! I seeded and strained the tomatoes helps to make the salsa less watery. Only used 2 seeded serrano peppers and one mild jalepeno pepper. It was nice and spicy but not too hot. ...

We ran out of tomatoes so we used just one tomato and one green pepper instead of 3 tomatoes..."
12/18/2008,5,I used Jalepenos instead of Serrano peppers but followed the recipe closely other than that. This is a great base for making fresh salsa. Some users found it bland or too hot or not hot enough. ...
12/15/2008,5,Love this recipe.  Its so simple and so good.  In a pinch I use canned diced tomatoes drained well.
12/14/2008,5,Made this with the Bhut Jolokia pepper and a clove of garlic.  HOT HOT HOT and gooooood!!!
12/14/2008,5,This is an old recipe that I have used for years. Delicious and quick to fix. Do let it stand overnight or a few hours so the flavors can blend.
12/11/2008,5,This is an excellent fresh salsa recipe. Be sure to use kosher salt when tasting and a pinch of sugar to sweeten.
12/9/2008,5,Very good recipe! We had to use canned chopped green chiles (old el paso)as a substitute for the chiles. It tasted great.  It's good if you let the tomatoes drain a bit so they aren't watery or...
12/6/2008,5,Suuuupeeeeeeeeeeeeer

8/29/2008,5,Great Salsa.  I only used 1 seeded serrano pepper but could have used 1-2 more.  I also added 2 large cloves of garlic.  Thanks
8/28/2008,5,Fresh and delicious!  I used jalapenos from my garden and probably a bit less cilantro as I'm not a big fan of it.  Will make this again and again!

It is wonderful because you know what is going into it and it tastes fabulous!

I always make a double batch because it goes so quickly! And I added it up this last time....."
2/27/2008,5,I have been looking for the perfect balance of ingredients for fresh salsa and this is it!!! As summer approaches I will be looking forward to making this with fresh ingredients.  Perfect!!!

SALT IS A MUST in this recipe 
but it is wonderful! Just need to hide it from the kids until I can buy more tomatoes...."
12/26/2007,5,Per the suggestion of other reviewers I reduced the amount of the serrano chiles.  I only added two seeds and all.  It turned out excellently.  Two chiles created a mild salsa.

8/16/2007,5,I used fresh plum tomatoes instead of regular and added a minced clove of garlic and I also used red onion.  I'm not sure if I can wait the hour till it gels since it tasted so fantastic when I ...
8/13/2007,5,Muy Bien.  Great recipe to start with if you like the fresh tomatoe salsa.  I also used the jalepeno peppers (2).  I liked this recipe because its small and you can experment from here with out ...
8/2/2007,5,Super yummy!  I'm so pleased with this recipe.  I couldnt even find the peppers called for used fresh jalepenos from my garden instead (only 2 wanted it kinda mild).  I love cilantro so for me...
6/23/2007,5,This salsa is so fresh and tasty!  I seeded the tomato before chopping which cut down on the soupiness.  I cut way back on the chilies.  WHAT A HIT AT MY HOUSE!!
5/13/2007,5,Excellent easy to make salsa. Very tasty. However instead of 5 serranos I used two - 5 is way too hot. I might try 3 next time. This recipe calls for A LOT of chopping so I'd recommend using...
5/10/2007,5,Thank you so much for the recipe! Although I know how to make salsa I always get worried I will forget an ingredient. I used your recipe when preparing for a Cinco de Mayo party last week and ...
5/2/2007,5,"when i first saw this i thought to myself how can this taste nice it's too simple. i made it anyway since it was easy and quite highly rated.

5/1/2007,5,THIS RECIPE IS VERY EASY TO PREPARE AND MY FAMILY LOVED IT.  I FOLLOWED THE ADVICE OF THE USER WHO USED 1 1/2 PEPPER INSTEAD OF 5 AS THE RECIPE CALLS FOR.
3/18/2007,5,Wonderful!!  Thanks!  I added chopped black olives. Yummy
5/30/2006,5,yum!  i only used 2 chilis cuz i'm sort of a wimp but it was SO delicious and fresh-tasting.  i'd definitely recommend 3-4 chilis if you love the spice but if you're wimpy like me 2 is spicy ...
5/9/2006,5,Yum! Exactly what I was looking for. I used two jalapeno peppers instead of the other ones. And next time I would reduce the salt by half. I served it with fajitas and with tortilla chips as we...
4/21/2006,5,Just what I've been looking for. :-)
1/28/2006,5,Delicious! My picky pregnant girlfriend was happy with it! I tried it with a lot less jalepenos instead and it was fine - next time I'll use more (jalepenos that is). Jalepenos were a nice subst...
10/22/2005,5,This recipe is wonderful but the pepper type that was listed was unavailable at my local market  I used two habanero peppers and it was smoking hot. Maybe 5 jalepeno peppers would be accurate.  ...
9/26/2005,5,This is a great easy recipe! I vary the amounts by what I have on hand and use less cilantro just by taste preference. I tend to use the food processor to chop the tomatoes and onions because ...
1/26/2005,5,This is an excellent salsa my family loved it
9/3/2004,5,this salsa was easy to make and very good
8/16/2004,5,I tried this and absolutely loved it. I did place tomotoes in boiling H2O for a sec and peeled and de-seeded them. Some might find a bit too much cilantro but as I love cilantro perfect. I'll...
8/1/2004,5,This salsa is so fresh and tasty.  I added a clove of minced garlic and used only 3 chiles.  (You may want to modify the amount of chiles to suit your tastes ~ 5 will make it hot hot hot!)  Also...
7/13/2004,5,"If you have a garden and need to use your tomatos this is a great recipe to make them disappear. my advice is to go easy on the cilantro and eat it the same day.

best with salty corn tortill..."
7/12/2004,5,This was a great recipe- everyone loved it!  I have made it several times and I find that 2-3 serrano peppers is just enough- not too hot but still with a kick!
7/11/2004,5,I used tomatoes with peppers already in the can.
7/7/2004,5,Excellent fresh salsa.  I too substituted 4  jalapenos for the serrenos.  Left the seeds in just one.  Also used a couple of fresh cloves of garlic.  Next time I'll make a bigger batch as this w...
7/5/2004,5,I agree with others 5 serrano chiles is suicide!  I used 4 (what was I thinking?) and next time I will reduce to 2.  I like it hot but those babies are HOT!  I also added 2 garlic cloves press...
5/6/2004,5,I just tried this recipe for the first time.  It was great!I couldn't find serrano chili peppers so I used 3 jalapeno peppers (with seeds removed) and it had a nice kick without being overpoweri...
5/6/2004,5,AWESOME! Following the advice of others I used less cilantro and added some garlic. As was stated by someone else 5 cerrano chiles (the small ones) is extreme and I too love it HOT! Recommend a...

4/23/2004,5,Excellent and easy to make!  Not many ingredients but the flavor is the best.  The 5 serrano peppers were a bit on the 'hot' side so if you like your salsa more mild then only put in 3.  Be sur...
4/12/2004,5,what a great recipe!!! My hubby loves it!
12/25/2003,5,This was the best salse EVER!  I used fresh everything out of my greenhouse including the cilantro.  The only thing missing is garlic.  I added two cloves per batch.
10/2/2003,5,So easy and so good! Has been incredibly well-received by everyone who has tried it.
3/1/2003,5,Delicious!!  I used 2 seeded peppers and it wasn't really spicy at all. Next time I will use all 5.  Awesome flavor and very easy to make.
2/1/2003,5,Very good salsa!!  I like the chuncky salsa and my husband does not.   I put some in the blender and we were both happy!!
1/19/2003,5,This recipe as written is what I have known as pico de gallo.  I added 2 Tbsp. tomato paste (use ketchup for sweeter) to make salsa.  Excellant as pico or salsa!!!
12/20/2002,5,I added some diced avacado and my family loves this!!
9/10/2002,5,Excellent!!  I used this recipe which was very good.  I also used it as a template for my own by changing things to suit my specific tastes and it has opened the new world of homemade salsa.  Ad...
9/9/2002,5,This recipe also tastes great with a clove of chopped garlic added.
7/30/2002,5,Wonderful flavor.
1/2/2002,5,Excellent salsa!  It is the bomb!  I got tons of compliments on it.  It's so fresh and AUTHENTIC.  Don't forget the salt though.  I forgot the first time and it ended up just being a bowl of ch...
12/3/2001,5,"Good! Reduced the cilantro to a 1/3 of a cup. This is what we call Salsa Mexicana in Mexico.
Great with grilled steaks!"
2/27/2001,5,Great liked it a lot. I usually put in less peppers cause I don't like it too hot.
9/14/2017,4,I used a pint of (sliced in half) cherry tomatoes from garden instead of larger type added juice from 1 fresh lime - 1/4 cup chopped green onions and pulsed everything a couple of times in food...
4/25/2017,4,Wow! This is a very tasty recipe. As other reviewers suggested I used 1 pepper and added 3 cloves of garlic. Even my husband who doesn't like onions loved this salsa.
8/2/2016,4,It's  really good! Very spicy! Does need the garlic and has excellent flavor!
7/11/2016,4,Great base. i have made this several times and it is always a hit. I made it as is once and it was way too hot. Then I made it with 6 Roma tomatoes. Really great. Then I made it with half a clov...
1/31/2016,4,I was feeling lazy and didn't have any serranos on hand so I threw everything into the Vita Mixer subbed serranos for one unseeded jalapeño and added a garlic clove. Pretty delicious for 45 s...
8/10/2015,4,I added 9 tomatoes.if made a quart. I did add some more lime juice 1 more teaspoon. It is very hot but I added peppers that were fresh crushed last year
2/4/2015,4,This is a great recipe. My only adjustment was using jalapeño peppers instead of Serrano chilies. I only used 1-2 peppers depending on how spicy I wanted it. Overall its a great recipe and taste...
10/28/2013,4,I tried 2 recipes and this one I liked more. The only changes I would make though is to reduce the cilantro add garlic and add the chilies to taste. I will definitely make this again.
9/11/2013,4,I substituted with jalapeno peppers I love Lemon and lime but for some reason I don't like it in my salsa (go figure) other than that it was good.
8/25/2013,4,Tried it today and it's pretty good (with homegrown tomatoes). I did follow a couple of advice from one person: I blanched onions and garlic and I added EVOO (Extra Virgin Olive Oil). I will do ...
7/26/2013,4,onion/cilantro amts are good just use 3 ROMA tomatoes and one medium sized regular tomato- just the sidewalls (no juice/seeds/guts) and be sure to add clove of garlic a bit more salt & lime ...
4/4/2013,4,I was nervous about all the peppers but it tastes really good!  Next time I will try adding some fresh garlic.
1/1/2013,4,This was good as written. It was one of the best things we made for our appetizer dinner. Simple and delish!
12/10/2012,4,Good falvor.Yummy.............
8/12/2012,4,I added 3 garlic cloves and I was out of serrano peppers & lime juice so I used 1 jalapeno pepper & 1/2 tsp hot sauce and lemon juice instead. 1/2 tsp salt was enough. Husband loved it.
5/19/2012,4,good basic recipe. You wouldn't want to use all those peppers. One was enough for us and you want to deseed it first. For something extra put 1 or 2 chipotle peppers in too!
5/7/2012,4,1st time making salsa. used poblano peppers instead of serrano and it still turned out pretty good. i included all the ingredients but didnt measure them just went by taste. it became more wat...
2/27/2012,4,Wanted to try my hand at all fresh salsa and it was really good.
2/12/2012,4,This is a great easy recipe that anybody can do. My suggestion: add chopped black olives. Makes it taste fantastic!
11/13/2011,4,Good recipe to start from but I would never use 5 serranos!  I used 2 and that was plenty.  Also added a little coriander to mine.
11/5/2011,4,hmmm....I used 1 jalapeno pepper....not spicy enough?!  May use 1 serrano next time.  It was just missing....something.  Maybe more salt.
10/25/2011,4,Great. Used way fewer chiles and it needed garlic...yum much better.
7/30/2011,4,I skipped the cilantro and added diced jalepeno
6/2/2011,4,On your BBQ roast any chile roma tomato onionor garlic till at least slightly blackened. You wiill be amazeda at the flavor it will add to your salsa.
4/27/2011,4,This was easy to preapre and delicious.  I did make a few changes to the reecipe. I knew that 5 serrano chiles would make it to hot for us so I cut down on those. I added jalapinoes intead of ...
3/29/2011,4,this was really good although  I don't like super hot stuff so I left out the peppers but added a sprinkle of chili powder I also added some lemon juice and garlic. It would have gotten 5 out of...
2/1/2011,4,This was amazing! However I did not use 5 serrano peppers. I am from the Caribbean and love love love spicy hot food (I even make my own hot pepper sauce) but 5 serrano peppers is way too mu...
1/15/2011,4,I liked this alot but brian didn't like the big chunks of tomatoe
1/2/2011,4,Pretty good needs garlic.  Great base.
10/11/2010,4,I used 4 tomatoes 1 small onion 1 serrano chile (use 5 if you want your mouth on fire!). *Tip: taste the salsa first before putting all 5 serrano chiles in.* I only used about 1/4 cup of chopp...
10/3/2010,4,I love this recipe! I had a huge tomato crop this summer and made this recipe with fresh tomatoes from the garden. I made a few minor modifications; I added extra tomato 2 cloves fresh garlic ...
9/16/2010,4,Make sure to add garlic cloves to this.  And like everyone else said...you do NOT need that many peppers unless you want your mouth burning!  One or two is fine.
9/12/2010,4,This was great- but only because I read the reviews that said to use less serrano peppers. I used TWO and it was plenty hot and spicy-- any more than that and it would have been inedible. But w...
9/3/2010,4,This is a delicious salsa.  This is the first time I've made it so I was pleased that it turned out so well.  Like some others suggested I did add 1 clove of garlic (but we're kinda garlic nuts!...
8/30/2010,4,GREAT 'pico' type salsa. The only change I would make: add one pepper at a time to get to the desired HEAT level. 5 peppers would have been TOO much. Otherwise perfect blend of flavors.
8/27/2010,4,Great Recipe.  I added one can of diced tomatoes w/chilis a little S&P EVOO & dash of Red wine Vinegar. Sooo tasty! Thank you!
8/17/2010,4,I was a little worried about making this using all 5 peppers but turns out it was fine.  Had a nice kick but not too hot.  I used the seeds of the peppers too.  Per the other reviews I also a...
7/3/2010,4,Great recipe! The only modification I made was that I used 2 chiles instead of 5 which is why I rated it only 4 stars instead of 5. I got a lot of compliments on it & my husband now asks for it...
5/14/2010,4,This salsa is yummo!  I added 1 chopped avocado 1 tsp minced garlic and a little bit of vinegar and black pepper.  We used this on top of home-made nachos with some sour cream... mmm.
4/17/2010,4,Definately a good salsa but it calls for too many peppers.  As with another reviewer... good tomatoes are a must.
3/9/2010,4,Yeah no way 5 serranos.  I used 1 and it was still very spicy.     Also next time I'd cut back on the lime to half.  Or maybe lemon instead.     But very tasty.
2/10/2010,4,This was easy to make and really good. I used several previous reviewers suggestions but  definately will make this again.
1/27/2010,4,It's pretty good. I might add a little green pepper and garlic next time. And maaaybe a Tbsp of virgin olive oil.
1/17/2010,4,Take the time drain the tomatoes for an hour or so before mixing with other ingredients (you'll be amazed how much liquid comes off with no loss of flavor).  It makes such a difference and the s...
1/16/2010,4,Very good.  However we like our salsa a bit more blended so we blended half the recipe and then mixed it in the other half.  I had huge very hot peppers so we used one.  We added a little m...
11/5/2009,4,I would agree with the other reviewer who said this was more of a pico recipe.  To have a more ... and you didn't BUY this? response add crushed canned tomatoes.  Other add-in ingredients are...
10/27/2009,4,For those who love spicy salsa. I only used 1 serrano chile and it was HOT! My husband loved it I could only smell it.
10/9/2009,4,Very good but way to hot will try the next time but cut way down on the peppers.
9/28/2009,4,Overall this is very good and fresh tasting. I used 1 hot pepper (not sure what it was) and added some garlic. super and also very pretty when using multicolored tomatoes i.e. yellow purple g...
9/26/2009,4,I would say this is more of a peeko de gah-yo.  This was really good.  But I was really wanting to make salsa.  If your looking for peeko this is a perfect recipe.
9/22/2009,4,Very very good fresh salsa.  It is missing something though and I can't put my finger on it.
9/17/2009,4,I added a clove of garlic and a little cumin.  Pretty Tasty.  However I feel like it's still missing a little something to give it a zing.
9/17/2009,4,I used 2 jalapenos instead of serrano peppers and it was still too hot for my taste.  I recommend adding peppers one at a time then testing it before adding more.  Other than that it was prett...
9/13/2009,4,This was good though I had to change some things. I made the first batch following the recipe except I added garlic and substituted jalapeno peppers as they were plentiful at the Farmer's Mark...
9/13/2009,4,its great so fresh tasting i added red onion as well yummo!
9/8/2009,4,Delicious salsa!  I gave it a 4 because I had to add garlic to get it perfect.  We also used a mixture of jalapenos and banana peppers because we had no serano.  My husband and I were both prett...
9/7/2009,4,I use one jalapeno not five serranos.  It made a very nice pico de gallo for tacos but I don't think it would be that great as a salsa for chips.  It was quite watery and I even seeded my tom...
9/4/2009,4,mine turned out as beautiful as the picture. I only used one jalapeno and it is hot enough.  thank you
9/1/2009,4,I made this today with two tomatoes (all I had)a sweet red bell pepperdiced red onions garlic vinegar and at first I really didn't know what to think of it but the salsa grew on you and I mad...

9/1/2009,4,Oooh I love fresh salsa recipes!!  This one was really good!  But be careful with the serrano peppers they're really hot!  I only added one and it still had some kick.  Thanks for the recipe! =)
8/24/2009,4,Really good! I used regular jalapeno peppers and only used 1/2 of one and it was plenty hot. Taste like restaraunt pica de gailo
8/21/2009,4,Sure wish I read the reviews before making this.  I doubled the recipe except for the hot pepper and it still burned my head off!!!!!  I ended up adding three times the ingredients to balance ou...
8/21/2009,4,I can't eat ciantro but the rest of the recipe is great.  Any idea for substitutes?
8/21/2009,4,This is a great basic recipe. I mix up which hot peppers to use i.e. jalapeno habanero etc. whatever suits your likes. Also I add (to taste) either chili powder cayenne pepper and cumin....
8/18/2009,4,It is an amazing homemade salsa but I made a lot of changes. Nothing against the original recipe. I made some modifications to fit my taste. I like spicy food but for salsa I like sweet tangy ...
8/13/2009,4,Very fresh and tasty! We used 3 jalapenos instead of the serranos (because that's what we had on hand) and it was delicious. Still not quite as good as the Garden Fresh salsa that they sell in t...
8/5/2009,4,This is really good salsa. I used a couple more tomatoes reduced the cilantro (to about 1/4 cup) added 1 clove of garlic and added two jalepenos. I also ended up using a food processor for mos...
7/29/2009,4,I added garlic and used a couple of fresh jalapenos from my garden.  I also used fresh tomatoes and onion from the garden.  Flavor was good but it's a little watery for me.  I think I will add ...
7/27/2009,4,The biggest thing I like about this salsa is how fresh and chunky this salsa is.  I don't mean chunky as in CHUNKY but compared to others that I have tried this was great.  Only thing I change...
7/24/2009,4,Very good but next time will reduce the amount of cilantro a bit. : )
7/13/2009,4,This was easy to make and tasted great other than the 5 Serrano peppers. Way too many peppers-as these peppers are extremely hot!I think just 1 or so would be sufficent. I plan on making this ag...
7/2/2009,4,As it is it's a decent pico de gallo a bit too much cilantro for my taste. The second time around I cut the amont of cilantro I added some pressed garlic (3 cloves to a tripled recipe) some...
6/11/2009,4,This is my first salsa to make....it is SO good.....BUT ONLY START WITH ONE SERRANO PEPPER THEN ADD FOR MORE HEAT. I did what one reviewer said and used 1 1/2 serrano pepper but it was still t...
6/5/2009,4,Excellent recipe and it taste great!
6/3/2009,4,Very good only if you do this recipe as is...it comes out spicy. Not over powering but for those who want a mild salsa or no heat skip the peppers and use regular diced tomatoes with no chile'...
5/26/2009,4,Delish didn't use serranos used jalapenos instead.
5/25/2009,4,There was no way I was using 5 serranos too painful! I subbed one jalapeno instead and it was perfect. I also added a clove of chopped garlic. Will make this again!
5/24/2009,4,Awesome salsa!  I used to live on the Mexican border and always miss the salsa fresca you could get down there (jarred stuff from grocery stores = gross).  I add a clove or two of garlic to this...
5/8/2009,4,I agree that this recipe is fine with 2-3 serrano & maybe a jalepeno. 5 serrano is way to hot. I also put this in my food processor to make it more like a salsa & less like pico. I add a pinch o...
5/5/2009,4,The only reason I give this four stars instead of five is because it was too salty.  Next time I make this I will use half as much.  A great base recipe though!
5/4/2009,4,Nice quick and easy recipe but if you like your salsa a little spicy I would suggest adding at least 1 habanero.  As is the recipe is mild buy tasty.
4/20/2009,4,definitely too spicy :( and i love spicy! i'd recommend 1/3 of the pepper. i also added corn to mine and cooked the peppers onion and corn for about 10 minutes before adding to the mix i like ...
4/5/2009,4,I let my son pick the peppers and Woooah was it hot!.. I'm more of a mild salsa lover but the rest of the men in the house like it hot!.. I only used 2 peppers too!  :)
3/25/2009,4,Beware of using 5 serrano peppers...  I read the other reviews before making this for the first time (thankfully) and only used one and it turned out really well.  The taste is very fresh and t...
3/6/2009,4,AHHH my mouth is burning! this is delicious very spicy though. next time i may try a different pepper or maybe just reduce to one pepper.
2/23/2009,4,This was good but had no seasoning.  I added Adobo and Chili Powder to add a little flavor.  Other than that it was delicious and fresh!
2/22/2009,4,Very tasty!
2/14/2009,4,This was pretty good but with five peppers it was too hot for most of us (four adults).  Next time I'll try it with a pepper with less heat or use fewer peppers; you can't beat fresh salsa!
1/13/2009,4,Very good and not hard to make.
1/11/2009,4,I made this salsa for the first time last week and have made it 3 times since then! My boyfriend ate the last batch in less than 15 minutes! I like this with only 1 or 2 serrano peppers more t...
1/11/2009,4,Definitely DON'T need 5 serrano peppers. But I replaced it with 1.5 jalapenos and a few dashes of chili powder and it was great.
11/9/2008,4,My husband like it...although it's not your typical salsa.
10/29/2008,4,This recipe is great! I have been looking for the perfect fresh salsa recipe and this lived up to my expectations. I doubled the recipe added a clove of garlic and only used 1 & 1/2 serrano chi...
10/22/2008,4,This is a very good basic salsa recipe however I would be careful with the peppers using only 1 and a 1/2 was enough for our family.  Not everyone can handle 5 of them in a recipe.
10/2/2008,4,I made this salsa for the first time a couple of days ago. It's really good but you must let it sit in the fridge for a couple of days and let the flavors marry. Also I would definitely cut th...
10/2/2008,4,Great flavor! Super easy! I used only one pepper seeded and that was plenty of heat.  I also added one clove chopped garlic and used red onion in place of white.  It tastes even better after i...
9/9/2008,4,This is a great way to use fresh veggies.  I couldn't find the right pepper so I used a jalapeno w/out seeds diced as small as possible.  I have never used jalapeno's before so my finger tips w...
8/28/2008,4,Very good salsa. Next time I'll use 1/2 a pepper and make it more chunky. ***UPDATE*** The second time around I did make this salsa more chunky and it did taste a lot better. Also I served thi...
8/26/2008,4,Great recipe.  Followed the below reviewer and added garlic and cucumber from my garden.  Left out the onion due to tired chopping hand - no other reason.  A tad spicy - I used only 2 serranos -...
8/26/2008,4,For fast and fresh with ingredients I had on hand this was good though it didn't have enough flavor for me so I added extra lime and a garlic clove. When I'm in a hurry I will make it again.
8/25/2008,4,Delicious cheap and easy to make. I agree with the other reviewers though I also used some garlic and less peppers.
8/19/2008,4,Definitely add a clove of garlic and (like almost all salsas) it tastes better the next day.
8/19/2008,4,I added 1 tsp cumin 2 tbsp. honey and 2 tbsp. red wine vinegar.
8/10/2008,4,I made this recipe last night and it was good but I felt it was missing something.  I used 1 jalepeno pepper w/o the seeds and a clove of garlic suggested from other reviews but it needed somet...
8/2/2008,4,Reviewers said to lower the pepper count I disagree.  5 serrano peppers is not too hot.  I might even say add more if you like spicy salsa.  Other than that I added some avocado which was good...
7/21/2008,4,This was very good.  I took others suggestions and only used 1 pepper without the seeds I also used 1 Jalapeno pepper without the seeds.  It was plenty hot for our taste.  I also added garlic a...
6/18/2008,4,I've made this with only 2 serrenos both chopped & blended.  It is great both ways!!
6/18/2008,4,We used one serrano and it had a nice little kick to it - 5 would be a bit excessive in my opinion.  I have made this several times since the first attempt and it's always very pleasing.  Also ...
6/10/2008,4,I give this recipe four stars because it is easy and great tasting. I only had Jalapeno peppers so I used them and added a clove of garlic and the salsa came out great. I think this is great as ...
6/1/2008,4,A good base salsa recipe that you can add a little something to depending on your tastes.
5/19/2008,4,I've used this recipe for such a long time now- I can't even stomach the stuff that comes in a jar. I agree that using 5 peppers is an overload I use 2 jalapeno's & chopped red onion. I also m...
5/13/2008,4,This is really good I did take the advice of others and used Jalapeno peppers but I also used a red onion and added some chopped black olives and a little garlic....yummy

4/16/2008,4,When you order a shrimp cocktail in Sonora Mexico this is what you get with shrimp added and it is delicious.  When we are vacationing there we can't get enough so of course I make it at ho...
3/11/2008,4,This recipe is good. It needs at least 1 large fresh clove of garlic though. Also it is crucial that you get quality ingredients. Tomatoes from the garden are best but romas from the store work ...
2/19/2008,4,My family loves the salsa at our favorite Mexican restaurant.  I thought I'd give this a try and the kids said it's just like the restaurant! Yummy!!  I guess next time I'll have to double th...
1/7/2008,4,Made this a few days ago to have with some quesadillas....turned out very well. The peppers and cilantro really adds a fresh flavor. The salsa seemed a liitle salty at first but after it sat for...
1/7/2008,4,Very good salsa would give 5 stars but the serrano peppers are just way too hot!!  Second time I made this I used jalapeno peppers and it tasted sooo good!
12/30/2007,4,My mom makes one almost exactly like this but adds garlic and only a couple chilis (we're wussy what can I say?). Excellent and simple but make sure you add the salt - it actually needs quit...
11/8/2007,4,This was the first salsa I ever made. It was really good and relatively easy. I made it exactly as described except I only used 3 serrano chilies. It had the perfect amount of spice for me. And ...
10/13/2007,4,I've made this salsa twice the first time I chopped everything by hand and the second I used the food processer. I prefer my salsa less chunky so it was better the second time. I only use 1/4 c...
9/29/2007,4,"This recipe is really easy to make. I made some changes to it coz' my family finds it too spicy.

1) I replaced the chillies with hot sauce.
2) Used a whole lime
3) Added 1 teaspoon of sugar

9/15/2007,4,This was very very good.  Only reason I give it a 4-star is because I think my daughter's recipe is a little better.  I will have her submit in the future.
9/5/2007,4,Very good.  The quality of the tomatoes makes all the difference in this recipe.  The longer it sits the better it tastes.  I threw in once clove of garlic.
8/17/2007,4,I also use jalapeno peppers with my salsa.  This is a great basic recipe. Very easy to make.  PLEASE remember to wear plastic gloves when cutting hot peppers...and do not touch your face!  I fai...
8/13/2007,4,Very fresh tasting. As per another reviewer I only used 2 serrano peppers (not seeded) and the spice level was perfect. Unfortunately I had run out of cilantro so there was hardly any I could...
8/12/2007,4,This salsa turned out great.  I tried using food processor as others had suggested but found it made the tomatoes too mushy.  Chopped the rest with a knife.  I had jalapeno peppers from the gar...
7/19/2007,4,This is a good basic recipe that can be changed to suit your personal tastes.  I use jalapenos from my garden instead of chiles and season with red pepper and cumin.
5/15/2007,4,"As everyone else said remember to seed your tomatos! A food processor will save you a lot of time here too.
I omitted the chiles (my mom is not a fan of spicy food) halved the cilantro and ad..."
5/13/2007,4,This was a very refreshing clean salsa. excellent
5/7/2007,4,Very nice simple recipe.  I cut back on the chilies but added 3/4 tsp of ground cumin to give it an added twist - quite nice!
11/12/2006,4,This is delicious!  I have to double the recipe because my husband and daughter eat this so fast.  I only use 3 serrano chiles instead of 5 and it was a nice medium hot.  I love cilantro and tho...
5/14/2006,4,Like others I halved the salt and seeded the tomatoes and I also added 1 tsp extra lime juice.  I used a few heaped tablespoons of chopped pickled green chillies as this was all I had.  The sa...
10/22/2005,4,This is the best salsa recipe we have found yet however it is a bit time consuming with cutting the cilantro.
5/9/2005,4,This is a good easy recipe. I do not like hot salsa at all so I used two seeded jalapenos. I also added two chopped cloves of garlic and mixed this in my food processor to get it to the consist...
9/3/2004,4,Ours tasted like window cleaner.
9/3/2004,4,when I made the salsa at school and it was good.
9/22/2003,4,My grocery store was out of serrano chiles so I substituted 1 seeded jalapeno pepper (I was worried it'd be too hot if I added more than that).  My husband and his football buddies ate it up!  ...
8/18/2001,4,I used 3 more tomatoes and a little less cilantro. I also added 2 cloves of garlic.  I mixed it all in the blender and everyone loved it!
7/6/2001,4,Very good.  I added 3 roma tomatoes to the recipe and used the blender to mix up.
7/5/2000,4,easy
6/29/2000,4,My family all loves salsa. I made this & everyone loved it. We have garden tomatoes now & this was great in this recipe. If you like hot salsa this is a good one! Easy to make just alot of chopi...
11/13/2015,3,I kept getting tomatoes in my weekly co-op share and this worked out great to use them up. However I did change it a bit for my taste. First - I don't know on what planet 3 Serrano peppers woul...
8/16/2014,3,Good. The way I prefer to make it is a bit different because we find the cilantro to be overpowering.
9/8/2012,3,Too much cilantro for the amount of tomatoes.  Tasty but overwhelming.
8/6/2011,3,didn't have alot of flavor I added a clove of garlic and chipotle pepper.
7/26/2011,3,It was okay.  Missing something that I can't put my finger on.
6/22/2011,3,3 stars only due to lack of essential ingredients and preparation. Missing garlic cracked black pepper and olive oil. Also drain the tomatoes so it isn`t watery. Nothing worse than a drippy s...
6/2/2011,3,too plain. use red onion add green orange AND yellow bell peppers A cubanelle pepper and a couple deseeded jalepeno and extra lime. let it sit overnight. all these different colors and flavor...
10/9/2010,3,The only reason why I am rating this three stars is because of the serrano peppers. I made a double batch of salsa and used only two serrano peppers in the entire thing. It was definitely spicy ...
5/22/2010,3,My husband said This is a great pico. I said It's salsa cruda. He said In that case it's not that great. I more or less concur with his assessment. As a dip for chips it's missing some...
2/21/2010,3,It was average
2/7/2010,3,I guess it was ok. The veggies tasted fresh but overall there wasn't that much flavor in this salsa. Some more ingredients are needed to make it better.
9/3/2009,3,I used 2 peppers partially seeded. It was really hot. Also after I blended it it was green/tan! I guess my tomatoes weren't ripe enough. Next time I'll use 1 pepper fully seeded and add a Tbsp ...
8/24/2009,3,Like another reviewer I added tomato sauce.  Everybody loved it.
7/28/2009,3,This salsa was just okay. I couldn't put my finger on it but something was missing in the taste. I think there was too much cilantro. Next time will decrease that but overall not bad not grea...
6/2/2009,3,Good. Prefer mild salsa so I added only one serrano pepper.  Also I added one garlic clove.
5/30/2009,3,good but needed more flavor added garlic.
5/24/2009,3,Very tasty although too much salt in the original recipe.  I added 1 clove of garlic which was plenty.  And I only used 1 pepper with the seeds which was not enough.  Looking forward to makin...
5/7/2009,3,This is more like pico de gallo (except sans peppers) than salsa which is supposed to be pureed in texture.  Other than that this is a lovely simple clean recipe.
2/21/2009,3,The flavor was fine but it was way too dry for my taste.  Perhaps I need to try a different type of tomato.
12/16/2008,3,If you add some Chili Powder and Cumin it is FIVE STAR!
9/9/2008,3,I agree with the other posters--great idea for a recipe but two very important points: 1) This needs 1-2 cloves of garlic. 2) We found 1 serano pepper to be PLENTY spicy. It was comfortably hot...
7/8/2008,3,This salsa recipe is wonderful if you either: a) use one jalapeño or one serrano pepper. If you use 5 peppers in this you will lose all ability to taste.
6/1/2008,3,This recipe is more for pico de gallo than what I think of as salsa. It was good as a condiment with the meal but I didn't care for it as a dip alone.
3/28/2007,3,this was a great base recipe.  I used jalapenos instead.  I added 2 tomatillos ancho chile pepper(the ground up kind in the jar) and vinegar.  Held up in the fridge for a week.
8/4/2005,3,Wow  - 5 serrano chiles were WAAAAAAAAAAAAAY to hot.  I would say 1 chile or use jalapenos.  I like spicy but this was burn your mouth not in a good way spicy.
1/16/2004,3,this was a great and my guests loved it
11/12/2002,3,Actually this is a fantastic salsa.  The reason I gave it 3 stars?  Because 5 serrano peppers is INSANE and I wanted to make sure others knew that before they prepared this.  Not knowing anythi...
8/6/2001,3,More tomatoes and less cilantro would have made this salsa much better.
5/28/2013,2,The recipe is simple and has potential. Healthy quick and should've been tasty.  However there is an excessive amount of salt.  It really only needs half the amount listed or less.  The pepper...
8/5/2012,2,Waaay too many chiles!
5/8/2011,2,I'm being generous with my two star rating for this recipe if prepared as written. It's very good with significant tweaking but by the time you get done doing so it isn't even the same recipe. ...
3/21/2010,2,May have been the quality of ingredients but I found this salsa somewhat lacking.
7/1/2008,2,Did not enjoy at all.
12/15/2005,2,Fine but not stellar.
9/24/2004,2,i didnt like this
9/16/2017,1,You said to add half an onion. I added half a red onion. Yuk!!! Too much onion. It would have been better not to have any onion in my opinion. Now I guess I can cut this salsa with some cans of ...
5/17/2012,1,IF you are a fan of fresh cilantro then I suppose you will like this recipe. I used all fresh ingredients including tomatoes from my own garden however the fresh cilantro ruined it for me.
5/9/2011,1,No thank you.  I quartered the cilantro and it still tasted too strong.  I will not use this recipe ever again.
1/13/2010,1,Never used Serrano Chiles... didn't realize they were hotter then Jalapenos. No indication on this recipe that this was a HOT salsa. :( Fresh Tomato Salsa led me to think mild/medium for some ...
9/10/2009,1,I followed the directions exactly. It is way too salty and way too liquidy. It turns out like a soup. Will not make again.
9/14/2006,1,I didn't know I should have seeded the tomatoes.  The salsa was soupy.  WAY TOO MUCH CILANTRO.  That's all anyone could taste. I am very disappointed with this.  Little flavor moderate heat.
8/25/2006,1,5 chiles are too many. My husband is an avid chile fan but 1 was plenty. These are very hot peppers... be warned
7/12/2006,1,The only reason I am giving this a one is the recipe should say to use gloves while dicing the peppers. I have never made salsa before and did not use gloves. My hands have been buring for hours.
2/21/2001,1,Tomatoes should be blanched and peeled.  Add Cilantro to taste.  Add garlic or SOMETHING to liven this up.
11/8/2017,5,This stuff is a HUGE hit every time I make it!
8/22/2017,5,I just hosted an eclipse party and this pretty frothy slushy punch was perfect for a hot summer afternoon. I found this recipe made exactly enough for two punch bowl sized batches. I cut way ...

10/8/2016,5,I reduced the sugar to 1 and 1/2 cup but I don't think the full amount would have been too sweet. Next time I'll try the full amount. I don't understand the lady who warned about the heat. I bo...

1/18/2009,5,delicious.  used only one cup of sugar and it was PLENTY.  could've used less I suspect.  kids didn't touch it for some reason but all the adults used it plus champagne for a yummy drinkiepoo.
1/18/2009,5,This punch was perfect! I just did as the recipe requested - the only thing that i think I will do different next time is freeze the punch in ice cube trays rather than in a big block. But every...
1/18/2009,5,Kids loved this!  For me it required extra freezing time next time I will do it the night before.
1/15/2009,5,A winner! And the best part is its so interchangeable - you can really use any flavor of jello with this recipe. And I agree with everyone else - definitely put only half the sugar!
1/14/2009,5,Easy tasty punch.  This is the first punch I made that completely disappeared.  Everyone raved about how good it was.
1/14/2009,5,Great recipe.  I did 1 1/2 times the recipe for a bridal shower of about 25 people and I didn't need the extra 1/2.  However I did reduce the sugar and got did the following for 1 1/2 times th...

10/30/2017,4,I've made this a few times and we love the flavour but definitely find we have to use A LOT less sugar.  about 1 1/2 cups.

8/3/2016,4,Used only 1 cup of sugar.  It was plenty.  Added a little coconut rum.  Good!

5/1/2015,4,use only 1 cup of sugar instead of what it asks for  add vodka or gin for an alcoholic drink with it..
3/22/2015,4,I wanted to try something different from my usual punch.  If I make it again I will probably only use 2 cups of sugar.  I still like my other recipe better.  Thank you!
5/19/2014,4,This recipe was great. I made it for my bridal shower this past weekend and everyone loved it! The only thing I did differently was use 1 cup of sugar rather than the full amount listed. I think...

2/25/2013,4,I made a small batch and froze it in muffin tins. I can take out just a couple of the muffins and make enough for one or a few. Handy dandy and tasty on a hot summer day. Added a shot of rum ...
1/17/2013,4,Whew sweet for sure but if you like sweet you'll love this.  The slushiness doesn't last long/melts quickly.  It does separate rapidly so be prepared to stir often and drink fast!  I redu...
11/16/2012,4,Substituted the pineapple juice out for another juice. Way too sweet for my taste but the kids liked it.
10/23/2012,4,I reduced the sugar that is why I gave it 4 stars and not 5.  I made a half recipe and used 1/2 cup sugar.  It was super luscious.  This is a new favortie at our house.
9/12/2012,4,Everyone enjoyed this punch I made it for a bridal shower using peach jello orange-tangerine juicy juice and orange juice.  I was told it tasted just like a fuzzy navel drink.  I thought so t...
7/25/2012,4,Good punch.  Agreed with other reviewers that it was too sweet so I just cut back on the sugar.  Didn't freeze it because I needed to put it into a dispenser.  Worked out well.
4/16/2012,4,Made this punch for a baby shower.  Used 1 3/4 cup sugar and it was still way too much.  That's the only reason I'm giving this recipe 4 stars instead of 5.  I wanted blue punch so I made substi...
3/24/2012,4,I just served this at a baby shower! I used only one cup of sugar and it turned out sweet enough. I think next time I'm going to use sugar free strawberry gelatin stevia instead of sugar and d...
12/14/2011,4,Really like this punch.  It was a huge hit at the Christmas party.  Has a little to much pineapple flavor to me but everyone else loved it.
12/6/2011,4,I also reduced the sugar to 1 cup. Very good punch recipe. Everyone at my party had some and enjoyed it!
8/14/2011,4,I halved the sugar and that was gracious plenty.  I also used the tip to mash the slush was a potato masher in the punchbowl and that made it impressively easy to work with.
6/5/2011,4,Great punch definately use 1 cup sugar otherwise to sweet found it to have a lot of pineapple taste pay use less pineapple next time.
5/24/2011,4,"I made this recipe using 1 cup sugar very good!  Here's the utensils that made it easy:

4/3/2011,4,Love the slush consistency! Halved the recipe and reduced the sugar. Saved an empty gallon hawaiin punch jug and filled that up.
3/21/2011,4,Good but makes a whole lot of slush!!!
3/13/2011,4,I left out the sugar and it was plenty sweet enough.  I doubled the recipe and found it to be a little watered down.  Next time I'll use a little less water.  The flavor was good and guests all ...
3/8/2011,4,It's good but don't plan on saving any left overs.  It gels up into a slimey drink.
2/10/2011,4,Punch was a hit but too sweet. Next time - no sugar. Thanks for sharing.
1/29/2011,4,I made this for a christmas party. Big hit with the kids but I think most of the adults found it a little sweet (even though I had already cut back a bit on the sugar).
1/17/2011,4,Very good. I only rated 4 stars because there is WAY too much sugar in this recipe. Because of other reviews I cut back on sugar and next time I will cut back even more. However the punch was...
1/17/2011,4,Not Bad at all! I did get comments on it too. As long as you poor chilled soda into it there should be no reason for it to melt too quick actually it stayed slushy all the way through! I tone...

9/3/2010,4,You can easily reduce the sugar by half and it is even better.  Or swap sugar for Splenda and use diet soda and sugar-free gelatin.   I really like peach gelatin and mango puree with lemon juice...
8/12/2010,4,I can't wait for the results of this punch I'm sure this will be as good as it sounds!
7/19/2010,4,Delicious punch.  Just a tad too sweet.
7/13/2010,4,Loved the convenience will make again fore sure!!
7/8/2010,4,Pretty yummy punch! Mine didn't really come out slushy even though it was frozen and slushy out of the freezer. Everyone thought it was good and my husband even had it for breakfast.
6/28/2010,4,This punch was SUPER good but it did take some changes. The suguar as most everyone has noted is way too high. I knocked it down to one cup and still felt like it was a bit too sweet.  I trie...
6/7/2010,4,I agree with the other reviews that the sugar needs to be reduced. I also had trouble getting my punch to slush consistency. The frozen mixture was frozen solid so it was just ice melting in so...
11/23/2009,4,This is good but not unforgettable that is why the 4 stars.  Reduce the sugar other wise it is way too much.
10/30/2009,4,Very nice flavor I used gingerale instead of Sprite or 7Up and it gave the punch a real bite in the back of your throat that was surprising and lovely. The slushy texture is key and received ma...

1/13/2009,4,Very sweet even with a sugar reduction.  Next time I would probably only use 3/4- 1 cup of sugar (I made a half batch) at most.
8/20/2008,4,this is really good. a litle on the sweet side but every kid drank it up !
4/2/2010,4,So good that people ask me for the recipe. Everyone has the same reaction - Jello?
8/12/2009,4,HUGE hit at my party however it was VERY sweet. I would reduce the sugar next time (and I love all things sweet). I still have the other half of the frozen punch...guess I need to throw another...

1/8/2009,4,this recipe is fool-proof. i messed up with the calculation somehow and it still turned out great! tastes like sweet fruit punch!
12/28/2008,4,I tried this recipe for a Christmas Eve gathering and most everyone loved it. A couple people that said it was too sweet even though I followed the suggestions of others and used 1cup of sugar....
10/12/2008,4,This was delicious but it was frozen solid and we had to scrape it to get it drinkable.  But we were glad we did!

9/10/2007,4,This was very good and very easy. I followed the recipe exactly.
8/4/2007,4,Pretty tasty! I didn't leave enough time for my ingredients to completely freeze but it was good anyway. Strawberry jello makes a really pretty deep coral punch.
1/8/2007,4,I made it with raspberry jello and it was wonderful. You definately need to take it out of the freezer awhile before you want to serve it. It was still completely frozen after an hour. It was ta...

11/27/2006,4,A bit sweet but still yummy.
8/14/2005,4,I served this at a baby shower and while it was enjoyed by all everyone kept asking for water because the punch was so sweet.  I cut back the sugar to 2 cups and part of that was Splenda becau...
6/6/2005,4,Nice flavour but way too sweet. I will leave out the sugar next time. I've had punches before with fruit like strawberries and crushed pineapple. I think I will add them in next time.
12/19/2004,4,I thought the punch was really good but I had trouble getting the punch mix to melt when I added the soda.
10/27/2004,4,tasted very good but was however a little harder than i would have liked and i didnt realize about the freezing part until i was ready to make it
9/3/2004,4,It was a hit at the baby shower I co-hosted.
6/29/2004,4,"This was a hit at my luau. I used cherry 7up

try adding some fresh lime juice next time. 
Thanks for sharing the recipe!"

1/3/2003,4,I made this up for Christmas Eve and everyone really enjoyed it.  It made enough for 2 punch bowls.  Very slushy and refreshing.
12/29/2002,4,The punch was good enough but ours never was slushy. I froze the punch 2 days ahead & it was a solid block. (Reminded me of the ice rings I used to make for punch). I don't know how one reviewe...
12/25/2002,4,Very good.  Next time I think I'll break up the ice to make it slushier.  I didn't do that this time.
1/15/2001,4,This punch was very popular at my daughter's 3 year old birthday. It is like a slush so a good idea for summer parties. I added the juice of two limes which perked it up nicely. My husband had ...
11/25/2000,4,The wait for freezing wasn't bad because I made alot of this a day before my party.  It was the making it into a slush that was a turn off.  I spent more time scraping the frozen mixture than en...
4/25/2015,3,Way Way Way too sweet.  The texture is amazing!  It has a wonderful slushy consistency but it is nauseatingly sweet.  People only took a couple of sips and we had half filled cups everywhere....
6/10/2013,3,Not the biggest hit. Made a lot
5/7/2013,3,OMG! The most delicious thing I've ever drank!
3/24/2013,3,I liked the taste of this punch but I found it way harder to make than I was expecting!  First of all even though I tried to stir occasionally while waiting for the Jello/water/sugar mixture t...
3/16/2012,3,toooooo sweet!!!!! otherwise yum
8/30/2011,3,Too sweet and did not turn slushy as promised.
6/4/2011,3,This was tasty - but I have to agree with the other reviews that said they had a hard time making it slushy. Mine was frozen solid (I needed a lot for a suprise birthday party so I made the n...
3/26/2011,3,I hate to disagree but I found nothing special about this punch and it was also very sweet.
11/2/2010,3,I liked it however it was a little too sweet.
8/23/2010,3,I'm not sure what I did wrong but mine didn't have a slushy consistency.  I followed the recipe exactly and removed from the freeaer about 2 hours before serving.  It went from large chunks of ...
9/25/2008,3,The punch is ok.  My only complaint is that it didn't stay slushy long; by the time anyone got to the punch it was already completely melted.
12/31/2007,3,This was good but the main problem I had was that it didn't melt fast enough. Basically I served 7-Up with a block of frozen punch in the middle of the punch bowl. When the guests left 3 hours ...
11/26/2007,3,nice... but a little too sweet for my taste buds. Next time I will add soda water and 1 cup of sugar only.
9/2/2007,3,This recipe makes a large volume of punch!  It was well received at a baby shower I hosted.  My husband loved it as well.  I made this exactly according to the recipe and it did not turn out slu...
4/26/2006,3,My cousins loved this (kids) but I found it too sweet. Next time I will probably use sugar-free jello and cut the amount of sugar called for in half.
12/26/2003,3,The kids didn't like this punch but we adults decided it tasted great with rum!  Maybe next time I will omit the sugar.  Thanks for the recipe!
5/1/2015,2,Way tooooo much sugar scary
6/3/2013,2,I made this recipe for a baby shower this weekend.  The overall consensus was it was way too sweet even though I reduced the sugar to 2 cups and used soda water in place of the lemon lime soda. ...
10/31/2009,2,We served this last night at a party. My husband said it tasted like Hawaiian punch mixed with 7-up. We had over 35 people at the party this was the only drink served we had a lot leftover and...
3/30/2008,2,Way too sweet for me and I only put in 1 cup of sugar. Maybe just needs to be omited seeing the jello would be sweet enough. Had to put more gingerale in to dilute it.
11/29/2013,1,I followed the recipe exactly. Once you pour in the ginger ale it turns the perfect slush consistency! But I did not care for the flavor combo and thought it was too sweet. And I like sweet but ...
12/9/2011,1,I made this for my daughters 16th B-day party.  It was way too sweet. I felt guilty serving it.  It was very disappointing.
7/4/2011,1,not good at all.
6/1/2010,1,I only used 1 1/2 cups of sugar and it was still WAY too sweet. Pretty dissappointed.
11/19/2007,1,it melts way too fast. guests were asking for ice halfway through.

5/4/2017,5,I made this for my granddaughter in law's bridal shower and her wedding.  My granddaughter has requested it for her bridal shower also.
4/28/2017,5,This recipe is light and refreshing and very forgiving.  If you don't have club coda you can use sprite or 7-up or any diet version of lemon lime soda.  If you want  to use champagne you can sub...
3/30/2017,5,I used the sparkling juice from Costco and I've never made punch so much at any function. I had to make 3 batches!
3/14/2017,5,I made this for a baby shower and it was a huge hit.  Not too heavy or sweet.  And worked for those who wanted to make it an adult beverage by adding champagne.

2/11/2010,5,I made a double batch at my Christmas party and it was gone before some people arrived! They kept asking if there was more. Next time I will make a quad batch.

12/21/2009,5,Very good but instead of using carbonated water and adding sugar to taste I used lemon lime soda.  It did sparkle and the sliced fruit was a nice touch!
12/16/2009,5,I made this for a Christmas party and it was so delicious that I had to keep refilling the punch bowl.  It is the perfect recipe if you don't want anything too sweet.  It is light and refreshing.

11/12/2009,5,Wonderful punch without all the sticky sweetness.  Used pink lemonade for a baby shower and left out the sugar. It was perfect.
11/9/2009,5,I simplified.  I used a ratio of 2 cups of Newman's Lemondade in a carton (no high fructose corn syrup) for each bottle of sparking cidar.  I made for an office wedding shower.  It was fast eas...
9/24/2009,5,Made this for a party recently.  They couldn't get enough!  The kids teens adults and seniors all loved it.  Will definitely make it again.  I froze the orange lemon and lime slices.  Beautif...

1/11/2009,5,This is the BEST punch recipe ever!!!  I made it for a baby shower (2 batches) and it was gone!  I'd like to try it sometime with champagne instead of the club soda for an adult beverage.  :)
12/27/2008,5,I've made this recipe for a bridal shower and Christmas dinner and both groups loved it!  The only change I made was using about half the cut fruit.
12/24/2008,5,After reading the reviews I too chose this punch recipe for my daughter's baby shower. It received an overwhelming response. I had double the recipe and we still ran out and the soda bottles we...

2/25/2008,5,I made this punch for a friend's baby shower and it was a huge hit.  It's refreshing not too sweet and looks great with the fruit.  I had several requests for the recipe.
2/17/2008,5,I chose this punch to serve at my daughters wedding based on the previous reviews and the fact that I had a surplus of sparkling cider. I have a warning for you-if you make this make about tripl...

1/28/2012,4,Made this for a work Christmas party at our home. It was very good but from the volume drank it was not nearly as popular as the pomegranate/cranberry punch sitting right next to it.  Would pro...
1/2/2012,4,Interesting.  I made this for our family Christmas gathering.  Couldn't decide if we loved it however we continued to go back for more and the bowl was empty before we knew it.  BTW also goo...
12/29/2011,4,If you don't want the fizz to disappear so quickly make huge ice cubes.  They won't melt as fast and you can freeze cherries or lemon slices in them to make a great presentation.  I use a 12 ...
11/15/2011,4,Very refreshing didn't need to add the sugar!
6/20/2011,4,Made this for my book club following the recipe with no exceptions.  For those of us who wanted to add hooch after trying a few options we agreed rum was the best. Next time I will follow oth...
3/20/2011,4,This was pretty good! My husband really enjoyed eating the oranges out of the punch bowl after everyone left lol.
1/10/2011,4,This is a very delicious non alcoholic punch. We've used this recipe a few times for parties and never have any leftovers even after doubling or tripling the recipe. A keeper!
12/21/2010,4,I recently made this punch for my son's first birthday party. I have a new rug and with lots of little ones I wanted a 'clear' punch. This was perfect. It was completely gone by the end of the p...

10/21/2009,4,Light refreshing and cute!
10/18/2009,4,Very good and easy!  I made this for a baby shower and it was a hit.  The fruit made a nice presentation and must have been tasty too because one kid kept taking the oranges out and eating them!
8/30/2009,4,This was good. It wasn't anything exceptional but I would probably make it again.
4/20/2009,4,I'm really not sure about this one. I thought it had an odd taste. I made 60 servings for 25 people and there was a little left (not a lot). Most people at the baby shower went back for seconds ...
6/3/2007,4,Served this punch at my daughter's bridal shower.  Everyone enjoyed it a lot.  Probable will add the sugar before the water & cider next time just to get it blended better but good recipe.  Th...

5/13/2009,3,we made a few alterations
10/25/2010,2,Not very impressed by this punch - doesn't have very much flavor.  Glad I tried this out before the baby shower because I will have to find another punch recipe.
5/28/2012,1,I tried this punch.  I always use the recipes that have 4+ stars.  However I was disappointed in this one.  It had very little flavor.  I will not use this again.
10/26/2017,5,"Great cake!! Rave reviews from potluck dinner!! 
One change - I would apply glaze in stages. Brush over poked cake lightly then wait a few minutes for glaze to set up a little . Continue at 5-7..."

4/20/2017,5,Wonderful cake. Followed suggestions to soak the cake in pan really good. The only thing I'd change is to use less pecans I also didn't use all the glaze. Will make again!
4/15/2017,5,Delicious recipe. The glazing took time but it was worth it. While I was doing the batter mixing I threw in chocolate chips. Very worthwhile.
3/25/2017,5,I didn't have vanilla pudding so  I used pistachio instead.   I used almonds in place of pecans because  I didn't have pecans.  I need to go grocery shopping!  Great tasting cake.  My husband w...

3/17/2017,5,PLEASE NOTE! When mixing batter is very thick. Kept creeping up the beaters and almost hitting the mixer itself. Had to keep shaking it down = messy. Also - I tried the trick of putting the gla...
3/17/2017,5,This cake is moist and I will make it again. I did as mentioned by another that you pour the glaze back into the bundt pan and add back the cake for 20 min.
3/17/2017,5,Made it twice!  Absolutely delicious!  Making it this weekend for a St. Patty party!
3/15/2017,5,This is a little time-consuming at the end but it is so very worth it. It is one daughter's go-to cake for her birthday and I MUST bring at least two for work every St. Patrick's Day. It's embar...
2/8/2017,5,This came out amazing!  I added the pecans to the batter instead of in the pan  as someone else  had said and sprinkled a few on top when I iced it.  Another reviewer had suggested painting the ...

1/23/2016,5,Very good!  Tip about putting it back in the pan to soak was great idea but it only took my cake 10 mins to soak all the glaze.  I changed nothing and it was perfect.  Thanks for a good one.
1/6/2016,5,This cake was a big hit on New Year's. I was out of pecans so I skipped them and used olive oil and it tasted great. I would make a half recipe of the glaze next time it was too much.  I can'...

6/11/2006,5,YUMMY. A PERFECT HOLIDAY CAKE

5/29/2006,5,Awesome cake. I used caramel puddign because I didn't have vanilla. 1/2 Bailey's 1/2 Kahlua and it was to die. For. My book club wants me to make it again and again!
5/18/2006,5,Fabulous recipe. I usually bake in a castle shaped bundt pan and only use half the amount of glaze recommended. Let sit overnight before service to allow glaze a chance to soak in.
5/6/2006,5,Absolutly one of the best cakes EVERY!!!

2/16/2006,5,I made this exceptional cake last year around St. Patrick's Day and plan to make it this year too.

1/31/2006,5,Sooo Good!!!  Thanks for the great recipe.

5/5/2005,5,This is just fantasic.  I leave the cake in the pan and pour the glaze over it while still hot.  Let it cool a bit then invert directly to a plate or cake pan.  It's easier and less messy.

12/13/2002,5,I love using cake mixes especially when one can't tell a mix was used.  This cake is fantanstic.  It is moist and easy to make.  The best part about it is the glaze rich and sugary sweet with...
11/20/2002,5,I've been making a similar rum cake recipe for years.  This Irish cream version has replaced that in my recipe book. This recipe is so simply and quick to make it's great if you don't want to s...

11/16/2002,5,This recipe is a big hit with my family! Everytime I make it I'm asked for the recipe or requested to make it again.  I save it for special occasions though.  Thanks for sharing it!

I handle the glaze differently than the recipe with much better results.
After I remove the cake and let it cool 2..."
7/29/2002,5,"WOW! My sister in law sent me a piece of this cake and i am embarrased
to say it was so good I licked the paper it was on.....nuff said!"

4/2/2002,5,I made this for a Saint Patrick's Day party then my husband insisted that I make it for Easter as well.  I brought the leftovers to work and had to give the recipe to 4 people because everyone l...
3/31/2002,5,I made this with my St. Patrick's Day feast and my father-in-law-- a picky dessert eater-- went back for seconds on the cake.  The glaze is fabulous and buttery.
3/29/2002,5,This cake is so-o-o-o delicious and stays moist.  The pecans and the glaze were yummy on top!  Everyone loved this cake!  Came out perfect.  Will be making this one over and over again.
3/26/2002,5,I made this recipe for St. Patrick's Day on a recommendation from a friend. It was so good that I shared some cake with two neighbors so it wouldn't go to waste. One neighbor said it was the bes...
3/22/2002,5,Excellent cake.  i made it for a St. Patrick's day party and received many raves.  Great flavor and very easy to make.
3/14/2002,5,What a fabulous cake!!! Glaze is messy but finger lickin good :) Made some sugar cookies and put the glaze on them - the kids loved them. Thanks

1/30/2002,5,I made this exactly as the recipe called and it was really the best pound cake.  I had to divide the rest amoung dinner guest in to go plates!  FANTASTIC  -  THANK YOU.
1/19/2002,5,Oh wow!!!  This was soooo yummy!  My only drawback was that when I tried to take it out of the pan it broke apart but that was probably my fault (sometimes my cake comes out perfectly sometim...
1/17/2002,5,This recipe was AWESOME!  It was great!  Everyone loved it and there was none left.  I made it for our family New Year's Day dinner and they are still talking about it.  Thanks!
1/9/2002,5,MMMMMMMMMMMMMM......this one's a keeper.
12/12/2001,5,This is a favorite dessert in our house - SO GOOD! The batter comes over my bundt pan when cooking so be careful of drips in the oven. But it is worth every minute of making this--TRY IT!
11/14/2001,5,Great cake! I ran out of Irish cream for the glaze so I substituted Kahlua instead. Worked just fine! I think next time I will leave off the nuts - seemed to take away from the Irish cream flav...
10/24/2001,5,Delicious cake and easy to make.  One tip make the glaze AFTER the cake is out of the oven.  I made mine while the cake was still baking and it cooled to the point of being too thick for the ...
7/15/2001,5,Excellent Cake to make Whenever!
7/12/2001,5,Very tasty and pleasing to the eye. I made it for a party and it was literally devoured within minutes.
7/11/2001,5,great cake! easier than it seems and really impressive for company. I must admit that there's a lot of Baileys trown in and I really don't know if it's worth it as you really cannot taste it. ...
7/7/2001,5,I made this for a fourth of July picnic and it went over really well! I only had chocolate cake mix and pudding available so that's what I used and it was absolutely blissful. It was a great us...
7/2/2001,5,"I had to reduce the cooking time by about 10 minutes.  The cake is sinful.
I made homemade Irish Cream ice cream to go with the cake - heck with dinner."
4/11/2001,5,Easy great tasting cake!!  Probably one of the best cakes I ever tasted.  Many thanks for sharing the recipe!
3/27/2001,5,Tried this cake for the first time on St Patrick's Day.What a HIT..everyone at work just loved it and it was gone in 30minutes !!!!
3/25/2001,5,"Outstanding flavor and moistness- went over big
at work!"
3/18/2001,5,Made this fantastic cake for St. Patty's Day Dinner Party and it was a hit!  Emailed recipe to several friends!
3/18/2001,5,Oh My God!!  This is moist and yummy.
3/18/2001,5,This is WONDERFUL! Serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Of course you can always drizzle a little Bailey's over the ice cream too....
3/15/2001,5,Delicious!  This cake was a hit at the St. Patrick's Day tea I attended.  Everyone abandoned their diets to have TWO slices!
3/14/2001,5,Took the cake to a class I attend and everyone loved it.
3/7/2001,5,Everyone loved this cake and we will definitely bake this cake again.
1/3/2001,5,Great recipe.  Very moist cake.  I only used 1/2 the glaze and thought it was plenty.
11/25/2000,5,This cake was a snap to make and tasted heavenly (especially since I loooove Bailey's Irish Cream).  I baked it first for my family and then for my co-workers and the votes were unanimous:  deli...
6/25/2017,4,It was good I prefer rum cake though. If I made it again I would use angel food cake mix.
3/17/2017,4,This cake is flavorful - but a bit dry which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  It definitely needs something to moisten it - perhaps a tad more oil.  I followed recommendations to remove t...
1/16/2017,4,Moist cake. Made it 3x already. First time I didn't adjust any measurements followed it religiously. The glaze is too sweet for us. So the next times I made it I only used 1/2 cup white sugar....
5/21/2016,4,I love bundt cakes like this - easy incredibly moist and yummy.
3/12/2016,4,"So moist.  Every tasty.  Big hit every time it's made.  It has become my goto recipe.  
Hint with the glaze to keep from getting gritty - add 1 teaspoon Cream of Tartar.  Keep heat low to just..."
10/29/2014,4,The cake was very good though next time I might take it out of the oven a bit sooner.  The glaze would not thicken and remained the consistency of water possibly due to the fact that I used ra...
3/21/2014,4,I made this tonight. Rich flavor very moist. My favorite part was the glaze. Very good!
4/2/2013,4,This was an unusual cake.  It was moist.  I didn't care for the frosting/glaze too much.  I think that would be the only item I would change.
3/17/2013,4,Followed the recipe exactly tasted the batter and added another splash of Baileys.  Next time I will plan on adding 1 Cup of it to begin with.  I used an angel food cake pan because I did not ...
3/17/2013,4,I made this recipe for my family for St. Patrick's day and they loved it!!  The cake came out moist and delicious.  I found the Bailey's to be a little overwhelming but the cake still turned ou...
1/7/2013,4,Everyone LOVED this. I don't rate it 5 stars because I think the glaze was a little too sweet but I was the only one who felt that way!
5/5/2012,4,A very easy tasty cake recipe.  I followed some reviews by halving the the glaze recipe and I think it worked out well.  My glaze turned out kind of thick and didn't soak in as much as I thoug...
4/29/2012,4,It was good but no one at work could identify the irish cream flavor even though I put in more than the recipe called for!!!   Not sure it's worth making although the pudding in the mix makes ...
4/12/2012,4,I'm giving this a 4 for taste - it was delicious. However the glaze seemed to be a little too much and when I tried to move the cake onto a serving dish (I probably should have left it alone) i...
3/17/2012,4,Well I am now on to making my second version of this cake - I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and removed the cake from the bunt pan to pour the glaze in and then put the cake back ...
1/30/2012,4,over baked it......still tasted okay but I have no doubt that had it been baked correctly it would have been great.
1/22/2012,4,This was good but not as great as I thought it was going to be. The glaze is amazing but the cake itself is so so. If I decide to make this again I think I will not do a yellow cake mix. I also...
12/30/2011,4,This cake was terrific and easy.  I don't bake often and found it simple and delicious.
11/7/2011,4,Good moist cake. I will make again. I halved the butter for the glaze and boiled for 4 minutes made a real thick glaze that had to be brushed on with a pastry brush. Thanks for a great cake re...
7/7/2011,4,Easy recipe.  Cake was real moist.  The only thing I did different was I made only half the glaze...glazed the bottom of the cake before turning it over onto a plate then also glazed the top...
6/1/2011,4,This tasted very strong of irish cream.  My hub liked it but one kid didn't.
5/5/2011,4,good but could definitely tell it was made with a boxed yellow cake mix.
5/3/2011,4,Made this for a get together with friends and everyone liked it. Nothing too special about it and I thought that the Irish Cream taste got lost in the cake. I did leave out the nuts just due to ...
4/28/2011,4,I'm not sure what happened with my glaze- I tried the putting it back in the pan with the glaze thing and some went into the holes and some pooled along the top and feels greasy- Is the butter s...
2/22/2011,4,Very good.  Made this with my homemade irish cream liqueur.  Reminds me of Bacardi's rum cake very similiar.  A hit at the office.  Very moist. Just the right bit of irish cream not overpoweri...
2/13/2011,4,Made this for a potluck and it went over very well. Put the glaze in the bottom of the pan and let the cake soak it up as well. Soo yummmmmy!
1/26/2011,4,My cake fell but surely can't fault the recipe.  The glaze was outstanding.
10/1/2010,4,could have used a bit more liquor - the flavor was a tad too mild and maybe some more oil - not quite moist enough. good flavor though.
9/5/2010,4,The cake does have a nice flavor and the cake mix makes it very easy. I would question the advice to put the glaze in the bottom of the pan and putting the cake back into the pan to soak it up....
7/23/2010,4,I didn't change the recipe one bit - did it just as called for and it was delicious! What's nice about it is it's unique. Very popular!
7/13/2010,4,Very delicious.  Used Godiva white chocolate liquer instead of Baileys.  Used sliced almonds for the nuts.  Sweet but not too much.  Very moist.  Would definitely make it again.
5/7/2010,4,We enjoyed this!  Only made half the glaze and it was plenty.
4/6/2010,4,Delicious! I used chocolate pudding instead of vanilla and loved it. I also ended up only using 1/2 of the glaze.
3/31/2010,4,Good. but I think I prefer my Rum cake over the Irish Cream Cake.
3/19/2010,4,Excellent cake. Very easy to make vegan. I've found that boiling the glaze for 5 minutes creates a much thicker glaze that is harder to work with. I boiled mine for about 2 minutes and added 1 t...
3/16/2010,4,I took the suggestion of another reviewer and used a Devils Food cake mix. Had a few left over pecans in the container so I layered them in the middle of the cake batter when pouring it in the p...
1/26/2010,4,My family polished this off in two days flat.  I thought the Irish Cream flavor was weak I prefer the Rum Cake recipe made with rum instead.
1/6/2010,4,This was pretty good!  I'll admit that I'm more of a cook than a baker but this seemed so easy that I tried it for new years eve and brought it to a party.  I stayed true to the recipe except l...
12/31/2009,4,The family loved but it was somewhat time consuming and spendy.
12/28/2009,4,This is more like a 4.5 star cake! I made this for my birthday party and it was so so good. I enjoyed it thoroughly. Would be 5 stars but I had issues getting the cake out of the pan. I'm sure ...
12/22/2009,4,really good except the icing is WAYYYY too sweet.  i would reduce the cup of sugar to half a cup. like others i used a full cup of baileys in the batter.
10/26/2009,4,I followed the recipe to the T this time and everyone thought it was very good; however the last time I made it I doctored it a bit and people were falling over themselves to get more. Thanks...
9/14/2009,4,Very moist and light.  Baked beautifully in my silicone bundt pan- although I did flour and butter it.  57 minutes.
8/28/2009,4,I tweaked this a little. Used Milk Chocolate cake mix & chocolate pudding. Made the glaze with cocoa.
7/21/2009,4,Absolutely delicious omitted the pecans due to guests with food allergies. Cooking time was far too long for my oven...it was done is 40ish minutes.  Thank goodness I checked or it would have b...
7/5/2009,4,Very good.  The glaze became a little crust-like but very tasty
5/31/2009,4,Yummy Yummy Yummy.  I use walnuts instead great!
3/20/2009,4,Very sweet
3/19/2009,4,This is a very good cake!  I only used half of the glaze because my husband doesn't like things to get soggy! But I wish I had used it all!  It's very good!
11/17/2008,4,This was an interesting cake! I'm not a huge fan of nuts in cakes so I added chocolate chips and toffee chips instead and mixed them into the dough. They complimented the Irish cream taste very ...
9/27/2008,4,I followed the recipe and the suggestions... added some Whiskey and 1 cup (instead of 3/4) Baily's Irish Cream.
8/18/2008,4,I made this as written and it was good maybe 4 1/2 stars but I wouldn't give it 5. Maybe I was just expecting too much because of all the rave reviews.
6/1/2008,4,I thought this was pretty good.  I baked as directed but used half as much glaze as was called for.  The cake was moist and had a nice flavor w/o being over-powered by the irish cream.  Would re...
5/7/2008,4,Good recipe good flavors!  I followed other's advice and added 1 cup Irish Cream to the batter.  But I made the mistake of adding one large box of pudding.  I never looked at the ounces in the ...
3/24/2008,4,I thought this was EXCELLENT but my hubby thought it tasted too much like booze.  He was wrong it was wonderful!
3/17/2008,4,Another keeper recipe! Made this for our St. Patrick's potluck at work and everyone loved it! Smells heavenly while baking too! It does have a good kick to it so it might not be the best choic...
2/9/2008,4,the cake was easy to make and tasted great what failed me was the glaze.  I don't know if i did something wrong.. but i wish i had not put the Baily's in the pot.  It curdled right away and it ...
12/19/2007,4,Most moist cake i've ever tasted. However both time I made this cake my cake kept overcooking. May have been the pan.
11/15/2007,4,A total hit at my business potluck today! Out of all the desserts brought mine was the only one to have only crumbs left at the end of the day. For me the Bailey's taste was a little strong but...
5/25/2007,4,Actually pretty good.....you can definitely taste the irish cream....very moist and tasty.  Loved the glaze on it - makes the cake so don't leave it out.
5/13/2007,4,This cake was really good.  However there wasn't a real distinct flavor of coffee.  I did however save the recipe by adding a concentrated coffee mixture to the batter. YUM.
4/16/2007,4,Very good big hit with husband and son and a great way to use up Irish cream
4/9/2007,4,Very good flavor. Very moist and rich.  I wish it didnt taste so much like a cake mix though. I may try it again with a different mixture of cake and pudding. I mixed the nuts in the batter.
3/27/2007,4,I made this cake for my husband to take into work for their office potluck on St. Patrick's Day. It was a huge hit ... people are still telling him how good the cake was. One tip: use baker's su...

1/25/2007,4,Very moist cake.  Great with tea.
1/22/2007,4,good cake but I followed some peoples suggestions and poured the glaze into the bundt pan and let it sit about 15 min.  The cake absorbed all the glaze and when I flipped it over none ran down ...
12/30/2006,4,I prepared this cake per the recipe but chopped the pecans more finely than in other photos posted.  I used a fluted bundt pan and drizzled the glaze on top letting it run down the sides inst...
12/25/2006,4,Great cake texture. Wish it had more of a Bailey's taste. Next time I would at least double the amount of irish cream. After the cake cooled a bit I poured the glaze into the pan and put tried ...
12/20/2006,4,I love this cake. It is very moist. I also like the fact that even after the alcohol cooks off you can still taste the flavor of the irish cream. I use this one always for Christmas potlucks pe...
12/16/2006,4,I love this recipe but twice now I've had major problems with the glaze.  It's grainy and solidifies within a minute of me trying to put it on the cake?  What am I doing wrong?  Thanks.
11/19/2006,4,I just made this for a Thanksgiving dry run.  Wanted to make sure it tasted good and that the silicone bundt cake pan I was going to use would really work...thumbs up to both.  I will be taking ...
5/25/2006,4,Excellent cake with wonderful Irish cream flavor.  Tasted much better without the nuts though.
3/19/2006,4,I have to make this cake for my mother's church group every March for the past 4 years - they LOVE it.  They like it at work too strangely enough even though I like irish cream - I don't care f...

11/7/2005,4,Very moist very good cake.  Everybody at work loved it and some even asked for the recipe.  You can definitely taste the alcahol in this cake - it does not cook off as much as someone else had...
10/16/2005,4,good but defintally to much glaze next time I'll use half.
4/18/2005,4,Very good but it makes a very rich glaze.  I had plenty left over after I poured it on top of the cake.  Perhaps the extra glaze could be saved to pour over the slices?
3/20/2005,4,I loved the texture of this bundt.  It was a little heavier than a cake but not as heavy as a pound cake.  The Bailey's (what else?) taste was very subtle if at all. The nuts under the glaze ma...
8/2/2004,4,Very moist subtle taste of Irish Cream everyone loved it!
3/28/2004,4,Wonderful cake although I made a few changes. I put the liquor and two tablespoons of instant coffee into my mixer and then proceeded with the rest of the ingredients. I then removed 2/3 cup of ...
3/16/2004,4,Moist even after 3 days. Smells great during baking and when sliced. I'm giving this 4 stars because I did not care for the enormous amount of glaze! The nuts on top was an attractive quality...

12/26/2003,4,I made this for Thanksgiving and it got rave reviews.  Very moist and super-easy to make
3/31/2003,4,This was a very tasty moist cake. I halved the ingredients for the glaze and it was just the right amount. I also used brown sugar instead of white for the glaze. My co-workers ate this up ( but...

7/11/2002,4,Made this for a family gathering and it was declared a keeper.  Very easy to make!
3/9/2002,4,This is very much like a rum cake with a little twist.  Everyone loved it.
12/30/2001,4,"I made this for an impromptu dinner and everyone loved it. The bundt cake was really moist and the glaze was especially delicious!
Would make again!
Thanks for the wonderful recipe!"
12/16/2001,4,Be sure you have the correct bundt pan size because there is quite a bit of batter.  Put a sheet pan underneath while cooking to catch any excess overflow.  This cake was really delicious it di...
4/4/2001,4,A good cake but not outstanding.  Needed only half the glaze.  I made it for a ladies' luncheon and was disappointed that no one requested the recipe.  Consensus was it was good but not great.
3/19/2001,4,I brought this to work for St. Patrick's Day - it was a big hit.

But no one in my family has had an Irish creme cake before and did they ..."

5/29/2011,3,I only used half of the glaze but the cake was still too sweet for my taste. I wish the recipe called for regular flour instead of boxed cake mix so I could have reduced the sugar.  Overall it...
5/14/2011,3,Moist cake but lacks the Irish Cream flavor I was expecting.
4/20/2011,3,I love the infamous Bacardi rum cake. I found this recipe and everything is basically the same as the rum cake recipe so I thought it's gotta be good! I followed the recipe to a T and honestly ...
4/6/2011,3,I followed the recipe exactly... and it was just okay I wasn't impressed.
3/21/2011,3,I followed the directions exactly but I wasn't all that impressed. It still tasted very much like a boxed yellow cake. My dinner guests on the other hand loved it.
3/18/2011,3,I made this yesterday for the first time. I followed the directions for the glaze absolutely to the letter but my glaze was more like candy than a glaze. It was barely pourable but I followed ...
12/22/2010,3,I will admit that I did not use the glaze so this review is only on the cake portion of the recipe.  I followed the instructions to the letter and the cake part came out very moist and pretty bu...
3/23/2010,3,The cake itself was very moist but I wasn't a fan of this recipe. I guess I was expecting (and hoping) that the Irish Cream would be the dominant flavor but it just wasn't. I think the cake it...
5/16/2009,3,Too sweet!
3/16/2009,3,Very simple to make. Everyone liked it very much especially with a dollup of whipped cream! Patience with the glaze let it soak in the poked holes. next time I am going to poke larger holes so ...
3/2/2009,3,I made this cake for my sister's birthday. I have mixed reviews I found the cake a bit dry. My family loved it however. The thing we all agreed on was the great flavor of the glaze.
12/21/2008,3,This cake did bake up beautifully. It rose well it's moist and really lovely to look at. It does have a nice taste but it's very very sweet. The addition of the glaze makes it sickly sweet un...
6/9/2008,3,Ok not great.  Seemed to get better the a couple od days later.  I used the method from a previous poster of putting the glaze in the pan and then putting the cake back in the pan.  It resulted...
12/31/2007,3,This cake was just okay.  The glaze was delicious but the cake rose was above the bundt pan.  IF I make this again I will only pour about 3/4 of the batter into the pan.
10/25/2007,3,This cake was just okay.  It was a little too sweet for my taste.  Probably won't make again.
10/14/2007,3,We've had better. The glaze is good but the cake is so/so. Probably won't make again.
3/28/2005,3,I don't know where all the rave reviews came from...  tasted a bit like butterscotch and was very moist but certainly wasn't worth the effort.
3/13/2005,3,Nothing spectacular.  I made it in a cathedral type bundt pan so it looked very nice but I couldnt even give away the leftovers to 3 different families.  Made exactly as directed. Not worth wast...
3/17/2003,3,This was a tasty easy to make cake but I don't see where it is worth the reviews it has received. It was just okay by my standards nothing that special.
3/17/2003,3,I am so bummed I didn't like this recipe.  I tried making it for a party and no one was really impressed.  I have never tried a five star recipe I didn't like but I don't think I did anything wr...
4/17/2014,2,Alcohol was WAY to strong. Followed recipe exactly. Won't be visiting this one again. Also use confectioners sugar instead of white sugar when using the glaze. Otherwise it's just not as pretty ...
2/18/2011,2,I recently made this cake (Feb 2011) and as I proudly decorated it I thought it was a beautiful cake.  However - it didn't taste as good at it looked. It was way way to rich (difficult to eat m...
6/16/2010,2,I guess I'm just not fond of liquoir taste in my desserts.
9/30/2008,2,My husband like this but I did not. It has a terrible aftertaste and I could smell the alcohol. It was just nasty to me. It really tasted like cake with syrup that is cough syrup. But I will gi...
4/5/2007,2,This cake was just OK.  What is all the fuss about?  I didnt get a single compliment when served at a St. Patricks Day dinner party.
3/19/2007,2,I followed the recipe exactly and I found this cake to be on the dry side and the glaze much too sweet. It reminded me of a dry Krispy Creme donut. There are a lot of great cake recipes out ther...
8/19/2003,2,I followed the recipe exactly and was very disappointed with this cake.  I thought it was way too sweet and tasted too much like a cake mix.  It did smell wonderful while baking
5/15/2002,2,Given the ingredients and time its just not good enough.
3/16/2002,2,although the recipe was very easy it did not taste very good at all.  me nor my children liked it . it was also sort of time consuming.
1/16/2008,1,It must be me because everyone else seems to love this...I thought I made it exact buy it's possible I did something wrong...maybe?? It was so strong (bailey's) we couldn't even eat it not even...

4/5/2017,5,This was my favorite oysters Rockefeller I did alter : used one 8 oz pkg of cheese for 24 oysters with one pkg spinach sprinkled them with bacon and parmesan when they came out. I did have to ...
1/3/2017,5,Perfect perfect perfect!!
12/23/2016,5,Wonderful!  I reduced cheese by 1/3 and added just a little more spinache.  I can see where you would have to adjust the amount of each ingredient based on the size of your oyster but this is a ...

1/1/2016,5,I had a container of about 24 already shucked oysters so I put them in some little shell appetizer dishes with the topping.  They went over very well. Thanks for the yummy recipe!
12/30/2015,5,Did add a couple slices of crumbled bacon to the mix and I eliminated the mozzarella cheese because it has limited taste and makes the mix too stringy. The only other minor change was to drizzle...

3/20/2014,5,We loved these! They are a lot of work though so make them when you have time on your hands. Great flavor though!
1/20/2013,5,Loved this Rockefeller recipe although there is no need to pre-boil the oysters when you bake them.  We hosted an Oyster Shucking Shindig placed open oysters over rock salt on baking sheets ...
12/7/2012,5,After trying these at a restaurant - I had to try them at home. I bought extra oysters to compensate for what i thought was going to be bad first try but they ended up perfect. I left out the mo...

3/11/2002,5,These were delicious & made a wonderful presentation!  I couldn't find Fontina cheese so used Gouda instead. They were a bit on the salty side so would recommend omitting the salt altogether.
1/19/2002,5,I made this on New Years and it was a HUGE SUCCESS.!
1/17/2002,5,"I loved this recipe let alone tasting great in boiling them it was so easy to open the oysters and I was surprised to see they were still raw. I will definitely make these again!

12/31/2001,5,We prepared this for Xmas.  It's an excellent recipe.  The only think I might do differently is add less salt.  Otherwise  this is a winner.

12/24/2000,5,We made this for my mother on her birthday by request and she was seriously impressed.  It was my first time trying it and loved oysters for the first time!
3/26/2000,5,EXCELLENT!!!!
4/28/2017,4,Did not have Jack or Fontina cheese so substituted Caiso and Parmesan cheese.  Great recipe!
3/12/2017,4,Followed recipe exactly.  Very good but not the best I've had.  Next time think instead of cooking in step 1; I'll shuck the Oysters live.  Also think I'll add some precooked crumbles bacon to t...
7/16/2012,4,Lots of flavor. Great recipe.
3/15/2011,4,I stuck to the recipe exactly but found the cheese to be overpowering.  A little less next time and they should be perfect!

5/4/2010,1,I'm sorry but this was a big glob of cheese.  Oysters Rockerfeller should be more spinach.  I should have know better when I saw 8oz of 3 different cheeses and only on 10oz pkg spinach.
3/21/2005,1,Did not like the flavor at all.
11/29/2017,5,Very tasty. To thicken this soup to a stew add 1/2 cup of flour after your onions have become translucent.  Cook for a couple more minutes then slowly add the liquid while stirring.
3/6/2017,5,Turned out great. Cut the recipe in half as only needed one serving and that was plenty for me.
1/29/2017,5,I made it just as it was and my husband said it was delicious

10/16/2011,5,Easy to make and delicious.  I made it for my father-in-law.  The ONLY change I would make is to not MINCE the celery.  A fine chop would be better in my opinion.  Served with oyster crackers an...

12/21/2006,5,This turned out so well.  Since I'm in MN I used canned oysters.  I grew up on them in my oyster stew so I figured it would be fine.  The taste is fabulous.
12/12/2006,5,Very good.  Used 2 cups half n half 2 cups whole milk.  Also used a red onion instead of shallots.  Although the container of oysters was only 8 oz it was still very tasty.  This one's a keepe...

11/30/2004,5,This was great!  So quick and easy to make.  I used fat free half and half and I didn't have shallots so I used regular onion minced real fine. Perfect.  My husband loved it.

1/7/2017,3,Not enough oysters in the stew for my taste. Also needed lots of salt & pepper.

1/15/2011,3,Not a lot of flavor. i added diced potatoes as well and thought the half and half was a little too rich tasting to me so next time i will use milk like before.

11/15/2010,2,I can't say this is the best oyster stew I've had. Not a lot of favour..for my personal taste you would have to add quite a bit of spices to suit. Definitely not a stew - more like a soup.  My ...
11/6/2015,1,It's watery with no flavor. I thickened it up with a roux and added paprika garlic salt and some Old Bay Seasoning to get a decent flavor. I'll look for another recipe next time.
12/24/2012,1,I made it per the recipe with the addition of the potatoes...it pretty much tasted like drinking half and half with butter.
2/5/2012,1,Very bland thin broth. Needed to be a little thicker. No one liked this dish
12/5/2011,1,Excellent recipe. I used 32 oz of oysters instead of 24. Other then that I left everything else the same.

4/9/2007,5,The way your fried rice turns out really depends on what kind of rice you are using. I try to stay away from the long grain or Jasmine rice when making this. I also like using left overs such ha...

4/9/2011,4,This was quite good.  I used the SPAM version.  I had to add maybe 2 tsps of oil to get a reasonable amount of grease to get the rice coated.  You could add a million things to this but as is...

1/25/2012,4,great burgers... the recipe could use some options like txatziki sauce or fresh green peppers for garnishments. thanks for the amazing burgers though :)
6/7/2011,4,These were pretty good. I skipped the onions because I was feeling lazy. I used ground beef instead of lamb and I used way more garlic and cheese.

4/7/2012,5,Excellent.  There was none left after a potluck.
3/29/2012,5,Pretty excellent. I used walnuts instead of pecans because that was what was in the cupboards. I recommend some salt and pepper but otherwise a solid dish. We added grilled chicken and made it ...

2/8/2012,5,I used feta instead and it was great.

12/19/2011,5,OMG this is good. My sister sent us some Harry and David pears so I was looking for a good way to use some of them. Thanks to her I found this recipe. I did not use the avocado (just a preferen...

2/15/2011,5,Wow this was good.  This salad with the mustard viniagrette was unbelievable.  The flavors of tangy and sweet was such a nice balance. The only thing I did differently was that I omitted the avo...

2/8/2011,5,Delicious!
2/7/2011,5,This is with out a doubt the yummiest salad I've eaten. I LOVE it!!!
2/7/2011,5,This was amazing.  Anytime I get a good from my husband (who is very picky) I know I have hit a homerun.  Thanks
2/1/2011,5,Excellent salad!!! One thing I did differently. I used maple syrup instead of sugar and it worked great. Also I didn't find that the avocado added anything to the salad. I think it's safe to us...
1/30/2011,5,Ditto this is the best salad i've ever had and everyone for whom i've made it has said the same thing! I would just recommend doubling the candied pecans and putting in at least 2-3 avocados....
1/29/2011,5,This is a wonderful recipe.  I'm not the best cook but I make this for every function that I'm required to bring food.  It's a hit every time!  Much of my family is vegetarian and they rate it ...
1/29/2011,5,follow directions exactly....perfect.  brought it to a dinner party - had to send everyone the link to the recipe
1/24/2011,5,Make exactly as-is and you will love. I'm a healthy eater but still have a hard time getting excited about salads - except for this one. It's one of those that is just right as written and if yo...
1/22/2011,5,My husband and I could eat this salad EVERY DAY!!  We absolutely love it.  Would not change the recipe one bit.  Thank you for submitting this.
1/12/2011,5,Its delicious just as reviewed by all. Roquefort is like $20/lb so I substituted regular blue cheese crumbles. I used a mandolin to julienne the pears which turned out great. Please please don'...
1/10/2011,5,Exceptional salad. My family is not huge blue cheese eaters so we tried it with crumbly goat cheese and it's to die for.
1/10/2011,5,I made a few simple changes:  I used all spinach red onions instead of green goat cheese instead of blue cheese and I used raw organic sugar.  Great recipe!
12/25/2010,5,I absolutely loved this salad...in fact everyone did- I made it for a holiday dinner.  I did use Gorgonzola instead of Blue Cheese since Gorgonzola is a little less potent and I wanted my kids t...
12/25/2010,5,Super delicious salad! Will for sure make it again. So flavorful and refreshing!:)
12/23/2010,5,Very good used walnuts
12/20/2010,5,One of the best salads I ever had. Didn't have avocado. Served it at a luncheon last week and all my friends loved it
12/18/2010,5,I took this to a Super Bowl party and it was a big hit. A fresh foil to all the fat-laden appetizers on the table!
12/16/2010,5,Got rave reviews on this salad by friends. Don't need to use expensive roquefort blue cheese is fine. Also added strawberries for color.
12/13/2010,5,Awesome! This is a wonderful salad for a special event. However rather than prepare as a tossed salad next time I'll arrange the greens on individual plates then add pear slices pecans and th...
12/10/2010,5,I made this at Thanksgiving and nearly EVERYONE had seconds on it.  It got the most compliments of anything I made!  I agree with the other reviews that the combination of flavors is just amazi...
12/8/2010,5,Excellent salad with a wonderful combination of flavors.  Also tried balsamic vinegar in place of red wine vinegar and it was delicious.
12/7/2010,5,I made this for my family's Rosh Hashanah dinner and everyone loved it. I used a mix of baby spinach and romaine I used plain pecans instead of caramelizing them I left out the avocado (this ...
12/4/2010,5,This was a great change for a salad.  I love cheese in a salad.  Even though I could not find any Roquefort I used Danish Blue which to me is the same thing.  Very tangy and a little sweet with ...
12/2/2010,5,This was great.  I made the dressing pretty much how it says and everyone loved it and I got lots of compliments on it.  As for the rest of the fixings I did change some things.  I omitted the ...
12/2/2010,5,I love this salad- in the winter I add Pomegranate arils for color- I think the arils add a nice tangy sweetness to the salad
12/1/2010,5,Amazing salad.  I prefer gorgonzola cheese (Trader Joe's is excellent) and I have tried several variations using green apples instead of pears adding dried cranberries and sometimes including a...

11/30/2010,5,Excellent salad!  My family holidays include signature dishes that are only eaten at that holiday.  My one sister always makes swiss green beans my other sister makes the turkey gravy.  I hav...
11/29/2010,5,Best salad ever! We always serve it at dinner parties. It's a huge hit!
11/28/2010,5,Instead of using Roquefort cheese I substituted goat cheese. The flavor of the goat cheese complimented the dressing pears and avocado perfectly. This is a favorite!!
11/28/2010,5,We had a spectacular turkey and dressing for Thanksgiving and three days later all anyone was talking about was the fantastic best salad I've ever had.
11/27/2010,5,Just made this for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit - great recipe!
11/26/2010,5,This is by far the best salad ever!  I get rave reviews no matter the company! The leftovers (if any) always go home with others!  You can change to danish blue cheese if necessary (all I had on...

11/26/2010,5,I thought this salad was terrific!  Made it for my alternative Thanksgiving since I didn't have time to cook a more traditional menu.  I used red bartlett pears red onion and a really good ...
11/26/2010,5,This was AWESOME!! Made this last night for Thanksgiving & it was a hit. The only thing I did differently was add a bit of water (about 1.5 tablespoons) to the pecan mixture so that the sugar wo...
11/19/2010,5,A super hit at potlucks.  I have added pomegranite seeds for a festive look during the holidays. I agree with some others that the avocado gets lost in the flavors so I no longer add it.
11/19/2010,5,Excellent salad!  I did double the dressing ingredients except for the olive oil as others had suggested and used blue cheese as that is what I had available.  Will definitely make again.
11/10/2010,5,Excellent!!  I substituted Romaine lettuce as that was all I had on hand.  Because I'm trying to cut back on sugar I just added plain pecans instead of making them candied and it was still exc...
11/7/2010,5,This was AWSOME! As I was making this salad I didn't think it would taste as good as it did! Thanks for sharing this recipe because I will make it again.
10/28/2010,5,Very good! Added craisins for a little extra something.

10/7/2010,5,I used blue cheese instead of Roquefort because I'm not a huge fan but WOW.  Probably the best salad I've ever tasted and the best part was the I made it!!  (i.e. it was VERY easy).  Will most ...
10/7/2010,5,Fabulous!  Easy and impressive!  I omitted the avocado but would add bacon next time.  Per other reviews I doubled the dressing recipe but definitely didn't need to do so and wouldn't again.
10/7/2010,5,Great salad!  Only one problem at least for our family.  We found it so filling (maybe because we ate so much of it) that a main entree was unnecessary.  Next time I'll serve it with a light so...
10/6/2010,5,My bf s the blue cheese fan I'm not reall at all but I loved it in this! Whole thing was just nummy!
10/1/2010,5,I made this last Christmas and sprinkled it with pomegranite seeds to give it a festive color.  My co-workers are still talking about this salad!
9/22/2010,5,Very good salad with low sugar dressing
9/22/2010,5,Excellent!  I didn't change a thing.  My five dinner guests last night all requested the recipe.  My attempt to carmelized the pecans was a disaster however.  I ended up buying some to use.  I'...
9/21/2010,5,This was amazing and very easy. I didn't even make my own pecans. I purchased them at the store. I made this for a bunch of men with a steak and salmon dinner and the only thing they were fighti...

8/22/2010,5,I think this is the best salad I've ever had!!
8/10/2010,5,Delicious!!!!  Special enough to serve guests.  I served it to six adults and they all loved it!
8/9/2010,5,Definitely a 5 star!!!!!  Is Chris' review from 5/2010 a joke!!!!! How can you give a 5 star rating to an original recipe when you have changed 80 per cent of the recipe then say your changes ...

7/9/2010,5,Any salad that has my kids reaching for second helpings is definitely a winner. So yummy!
7/3/2010,5,Wonderful as written.  However not being a fan of roquefort I substituted gorgonzola and candied pecans for walnut allergies...just as delicious!  We make the dressing for all our salads now.

5/21/2010,5,I substituted fresh mixed greens and feta instead of Roquefort. Also red onions instead of green and walnuts instead of pecans. Doesn't matter.  What I did a bit different is carmelize the nuts...
4/27/2010,5,Excellent salad!  I used hearts of romaine instead of leaf lettuce.  Made the dressing a few hours  ahead of time and kept it in a shaker.  Used dijon mustard instead of regular mustard.  Take d...
4/25/2010,5,Very good just as written. Will be making again.
4/25/2010,5,This is really a great salad!! I didn't use the Roquefort cheese as we aren't big fans of blue cheese. I used Feta instead which worked really well!! I doubled the amount of dressing too just to...
4/19/2010,5,Very easy to make and even yummy to taste! No need to change a single thing.
4/18/2010,5,Always get compliments for this salad. I have a friend with a nut allergy so I substitute dried cranberries for the pecans. Delicious!
4/17/2010,5,This salad is delicious!  I love the combination of ingredients.  Sometimes I eat this salad as a meal in itself.  It also tastes good with chopped cooked chicken breast.
4/14/2010,5,Made this over Thanksgiving and everyone loves it! Will definitely make it again. Roquefort was too expensive so I substitute it with blue cheese.
4/10/2010,5,This is my go to recipe to wow guests.  One change I make is to candy the pecans with sugar and generous amounts of pumpkin pie spice.  It really adds some zing.
4/10/2010,5,I made this salad with our Easter dinner.  Everyone loved it!  I especially liked it because I was able to do most of the prep work the night before.  All I had to do before dinner was cut the p...

3/29/2010,5,Excellent balance of bitter-sweet
3/29/2010,5,A new favourite. Glad I read the review that said to make extra candied pecans to have on hand. It comes in handy when you want to just whip this salad up.  My guy and I had a similar salad in a...

8/13/2009,5,I've made this several times and have gotten rave reviews each time. It's even becoming legendary. Sometimes I omit the avocado and drop a pinch of thyme into the dressing. It's delicious both w...
8/12/2009,5,Fantastic! Ingredients are a little expensive but it's a great treat.
8/12/2009,5,This has become a family favourite!!  The dressing is wonderful with a nice garlicy tang to it.  Works fine with any blue cheese I use stilton most often.  Also I don't use avocado all the tim...
8/11/2009,5,Great salad! I already made it twice! The second time I used Blue Danish cheese instead of Roquefort as it is a little milder and walnuts instead of pecans. It goes very well with the recipe ...

7/15/2009,5,Oh so fantastic!!!  A big hit!
7/13/2009,5,Excellent salad.  Regarding carmelizing the pecans I tried it both ways with and without adding water to the sugar.  If you add water the sugar becomes dry and tasteless but the pecans are s...

5/31/2008,5,Made this for a girl's night. Everyone went back 3 times! I usually am hesitant at trying new salads but this one was really a winner. I didn't add water when carmelizing the peacans and it tur...
5/21/2008,5,This salad is FANTASTIC! It's even better than my favorite salad from my local gourmet restaurant. Double the dressing and serve it on the side. Don't mix in the avocado. Sprinkle it on top at t...
5/21/2008,5,My guests loved this recipe.  I can't wait to make it again.
5/16/2008,5,This was delicious. I used romaine lettuce and dijon mustard in the dressing.  It does make a lot of dressing so adjust to amount of lettuce.  Will be making this again.
5/15/2008,5,This salad was a huge hit at our party.  I tripled the recipe and substituted crumbled bacon for the avocado.  I also grilled the pears a day in advance.  I tossed the dressing with the lettuce...

5/5/2008,5,This was excellent! Made it 3 times in a week!
5/1/2008,5,I would give this recipe 100 stars if possible it is that divine.  I was convinced I did not like blue cheese until I had this salad and lets just say I have been converted.  All the flavors a...

4/2/2008,5,I would lessen the cheese next time - it was too strong for me.  Otherwise this is an excellent dish - especially to take to potlucks.
3/26/2008,5,Very impressive.  A couple of notes I did not need to use all of the dressing and still felt the salad was amply covered so you may want to toss with half to check coating and then add the rest...
3/25/2008,5,Yum!  This salad is awesome and the presentation was beautiful.  The only thing I did differently was to add feta instead of the Roquefort because I don't like blue cheese.
3/23/2008,5,dressing is awesome.
3/19/2008,5,I made a marinated flank steak and sliced it up and put it in the salad!!
3/17/2008,5,Thumbs up!! It tasted great even without the cheese!

8/13/2007,5,This salad is the best!! I absolutely LOVE it! It is great for family or company! I didn't have roquefort cheese so I used feta and it was still great! The dressing is amazing! Thank you!
8/13/2007,5,This is one of my most favorite recipes ever from allrecipes.  Instead of a head of lettuce I use 3 different kinds of bagged leaf lettuces.  If the crowd isn't small I always double the recipe....

7/29/2007,5,This salad received rave reviews at my party. It is so different from anything that you normally see served and the flavors are great. I would suggest NOT dressing the salad until right before....

5/30/2007,5,This salad is delicious!  It has never failed to receive rave reviews from guests...also has never failed to prompt a request for the recipe.
5/27/2007,5,Wonderful!! You need to add a little more than one Tbs of water to the peacans to get them caramelized. I used Gorgonzola cheese instead. The BEST salad introduced on this website!!

4/4/2007,5,"A great salad!!
However with such a high calorie content I wouldn't make it again for a side salad.  Next time I will cook up some chicken and add it so that the salad can be a whole meal."
3/31/2007,5,We have used this recipe a number of times ranging from intimate dinner parties to large buffets and each and everytime received rave reviews.  Try it with Dijon mustard for a slight variation...
3/26/2007,5,"I made this for my girlfriends (vegetarians) and they LOVED it!!

You can always add some grilled chicken to this recipe too!"

11/25/2006,5,This salad is PHENOMENAL

10/25/2006,5,Excellent!  You have to be a big fan of blue cheese which I am because it stands out in this salad but the pears and dressing are an excellent touch to this salad!
10/23/2006,5,Well worth the effort.  This salad travels quite well if you make the pecans and dressing in advance and chop and assemble at your destination.
10/22/2006,5,Incredible salad! The dressing is so refreshing and compliments the salad perfectly. When I caramelized the pecans the sugar crystalized on them. I added the tablespoon of water as one reviewer ...

9/14/2006,5,Mmmmm good.  I would absolutely serve this salad for company.  It just takes a little extra time to carmelize the pecans but so worth it.  This salad has creamy & crunchy-right up my alley!
9/12/2006,5,This salad is one my favorites and has been a hit with everyone I've made it for.  I didn't change anything... although I prefer it with Bosc pears.

9/11/2006,5,Wow! Wow! Wow! Even if you hate blue cheese... WOW! Best salad ever hands down. There should be a 6/5 stars option just for this one... we use mellow blue cheese instead though!

8/9/2006,5,Excellent salad..You need to double the salad dressing.  Very well liked.  I used feta as my family likes it.

7/28/2006,5,Omitted the avacado nobody in the house likes it. Great salad.
7/28/2006,5,A delightful salad. One thing I do differently however is to only use two pears and add pieces of ripe sweet honeydew melon and cantaloupe. Yummy!
7/27/2006,5,Wonderful with beef. I used Stilton instead of Roquefort. It was excellent.

A little tip is to add a little lemon juice with your pears so they do not brown in the salad."
5/28/2005,5,This was a beautiful and delicious salad. I used a prepared Honey Dijon dressing in place of the recipe and it turned out very well. I'll definitely be making this again. Thanks.
5/22/2005,5,The only change I made was using splenda instead of the sugar and it was very good.   Thanks for the tasty addition to my recipe box.
5/16/2005,5,Awesome recipe.  I've made it twice already in less than 10 days.  I'd never sugar coated pecans before and overcooked it a little.  So make sure you cook on low heat!
5/9/2005,5,This recipe is fabulous but I must admit I do make a few changes.  First I add only a pinch of salt rather than a 1/2 tsp to the dressing - I find 1/2 tsp makes the dressing too salty.  I us...

3/24/2005,5,This salad was a great hit.  Guests left wiith the recipe in hand.  I thought the avocado adds a nice touch and makes it different than other cheese/pear salads.  Thanks for the recipe!

3/20/2005,5,The best salad ever.  Well worth the effort.  Every bite disappeared.

3/10/2005,5,This was very good.  It's something you can serve at a dinner party and be proud of it.  One note I added a little bit of water (1/8 cup) to the sugar to make sure it dissolved.  I didn't have ...

2/10/2005,5,This salad was Great!  I did not add the avocado because we don't like them.  I also used feta cheese instead of Roquefort because we don't like that either.  It was really good.
2/4/2005,5,Wow... just follow the recipe and you will have an incredible addition to your meal!
2/1/2005,5,Excellent! Don't change a thing. This is a great combination of flavors. You can use about half the sugar for camelizing the pecans.

1/16/2016,5,Everyone loved it including me. It is great because for variety one can experiment with ingredients. One thing I would not change wasl carmelizing the pecans. Thanks Michelle
1/11/2016,5,I love this salad!  I make it all the time.  I use spinach instead of lettuce.  I've used Gorgonzola instead of Roquefort and it was great too!
1/10/2016,5,I did not make any changes.  Everyone wanted the recipe. Delicious!!! I will make this for every occasion
1/10/2016,5,Maybe only needs two pears but it's an outstanding salad.  The avocado adds a really nice creaminess. Very well balanced and the mustard vinaigrette works great with pears!!!
1/3/2016,5,Love this recipe!  I substitute crumbled blue cheese and candied pecans already made from Trader Joe's .  You can always drizzle and stir in dressing so if you are not a fan of an overly dresse...
1/1/2016,5,A new favorite.  My kids who like blue cheese loved this; those who do not care for stronger cheeses didn't.  This is a sure-bet for anyone who likes blue cheese.  Thanks for the great recipe!

12/27/2015,5,Awesome!!!

12/14/2015,5,Great salad... Next time I'll use less cheese and the recommended amount of dressing (I had doubled it this time).  For personal  preference I'll also leave out the onions.
12/13/2015,5,Made for an early family Christmas dinner.  I made another salad in case the kids didn't like the blue cheese but didn't need to as they loved this too!  The caramelized Pecans really topped it...

5/27/2012,4,Excellent salad.Although I did not care for the roquefort cheese. It was way too bitter or too tangy. Just not a good fit. I think I would substitute the cheese for feta. Or omit the cheese peri...
1/19/2012,4,Forgot green onions and no cheese.  Use these and rate again.  All liked but would have been better.
1/16/2012,4,Very good! Nice mix of sweetness but not the best salad as everyone is raving
1/8/2012,4,"Great taste combo. I substituted spinach for lettuce and there was
Too much dressing. It was pretty greasy I'd reduce the olive oil next time."
1/5/2012,4,The dressing is fantastic!
12/3/2011,4,The dressing was a little tangy for me on all of the bites of salad that didn't have sweet pears or pecans to even things out.  My husband didn't care for the texture of the pecans but I though...
11/25/2011,4,I made this yesterday (for the first time) to take to a Thanksgiving dinner.  The only reason I am giving it four stars instead of five is because I thought it was a little too pungent for my ta...
11/16/2011,4,"Love it so many flavors. 
I used Dijon mustard instead of regular mustard but didn't change anything else."
10/3/2011,4,"a confirmed blue cheese hater; I found it pallatable in this salad in small amounts. 
Round two I sub'ed in feta as suggested by others and yummo.  
I added a small amount of butter to the melte..."
9/13/2011,4,Im giving this a 4. Not quite a 5 star recipe. But pretty dang good for a salad. I liked the combination of pear and pecan and the tang of the dressing. but me being a carnivore I thought it sh...
5/24/2011,4,simple delicious
5/22/2011,4,i really liked this salad. the pecans and blue cheese was great. i made the mistake of making my salad a night ahead of time for lunch and by the time i got to work my pear was mushy. not too ba...
4/25/2011,4,Very nice dressing.  Made this salad for Easter dinner and it was lovely paired with roasted lamb.  Very fresh and tangy with interesting textures. I will make this again!
3/23/2011,4,I tried this and loved it! Gave 4 stars because I didn't like the Roquefort cheese. I prefer a milder and creamier Rosenborg.
3/14/2011,4,I really loved the combination of flavors in this salad but I didn't care for the dressing.  It was too tart for us so I'll be looking to make some improvements next time but I will make this sa...
12/28/2010,4,Very good dressing (though I cut the sugar down to 1/2 tsp). I used crumbled goat cheese instead of roquefort in the salad since some of my family don't like anything that's a blue cheese or re...
10/17/2010,4,This salad was good but *really* intense. Very strong flavor and a heavy salad. I served this as a side with Christmas dinner and it overwhelmed everything else. It would've been perfect if i...
10/6/2010,4,Very unique salad.  It is a great combination of ingredients.  I give it four stars because I think the flavor of the dressing is a little too strong.  Next time I might try using less mustard.
8/9/2010,4,I really enjoyed this salad.  I think for 6 servings you should double the dressing and pecans because both are so delicious but there's not quite enough of either to go around.  I also used ...
7/1/2010,4,Delicious salad! It did not make enough dressing though. I didn't add avocado and it was still fabulous.
6/23/2010,4,I UUSED FETA AS I DONT CARE FOR THE OTHER CHEESE.
3/13/2010,4,really good
2/6/2010,4,I loved this recipe it had a very distinct flavor however my husband was not fond of the Blue cheese taste.  You have to like Blue cheese in order to appreciate this salad which I did!
12/28/2009,4,Made this for Christmas dinner and everyone raved about it.  I didnt add the avocado because I didnt want it to brown in the salad.  I also added dried cranberries.  For me however I thought t...
12/26/2009,4,I enjoyed the flavors of this salad very much.  I cheated a bit though and used store-bought pecans that were already sugared but other than that followed the recipe exactly.  I enjoyed the way ...
12/3/2009,4,This was very good. I served it with our Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it :)
11/29/2009,4,This was a good salad - I make a salad similar to this but I use balsamic vinegar instead of red wine. I liked this dressing though.  I used plain walnuts for time saving but I would like to tr...
11/6/2009,4,I had to substitute gorgonzola cheese for the roqufort and walnuts instead of pecans based on what I had in the house but it was still delicious.
11/2/2009,4,I served this to my friends who are not huge fans of salad and they really liked it. The blend of avocado pear and the dressing worked really well. When I originally made the dressing I found i...
11/2/2009,4,I made this salad last night for a party and I think like half of my guests said it was the highlight of the dinner because they have never tried a salad with this great variety and it's still...
10/29/2009,4,The nuts are DIVINE!! We threw away the dressing but the base of this salad (avocado pear spinach and romaine) was perfect!
8/18/2009,4,Make using pecans or walnuts.
5/7/2009,4,The execution of flavors in this salad is nigh on perfect. The candied pecans against the tangy creamy cheese. The lightly seasoned vinaigrette. Well done. That said the process for making the...
3/7/2009,4,I'd looked forward to trying this salad for a while.  It was quite good but could have been better if I'd chosen firmer pears and avacado I think.  As it was the softer pears and avacado kind...
12/29/2008,4,I really enjoyed this recipe. My only suggestion is to wait until the last minute to add the pears. Once I added the pears the lettuce wilted and made for a mushy salad. I also used candied pec...
12/22/2008,4,I made it exactly as directed but found there was too much cheese! Roquefort is pretty strong and a little overwhelming in the salad. Half as much will probably make it perfect. Apart from that...
10/21/2008,4,We liked the combinations of this salad a lot.  The dressing was not a favorite for all of us but I liked it.  I will make this again but maybe testing it out with another dressing.
10/20/2008,4,SO GOOD!  I couldn't stop eating the pecans when they were done.  I had to use red onion rather than green but cut it paper thin.  The dressing was good but a little too tart for us.  I used gor...
10/19/2008,4,Very very good.  I loved the pecans and pear combo.  Wasn't as impressed with the dressing.  Didn't stop me from eating a huge bowl though!
10/15/2008,4,Good. I especially liked the avocado. Next time I may try with feta cheese instead as I am still not sold on being a blue cheese fan.
10/9/2008,4,I added prisciutto to this salad and it was amazing! I highly recommend doing so.  A quarter of a pound thinly sliced made three salads. I kept the ingredients in the dressing the same but chan...
9/18/2008,4,A very sophisticated salad for a very sophisticated palate. The dressing was simple and a perfect complement for the complex flavors of the salad itself. Thanks for sharing.
9/11/2008,4,I really like this salad.  As others suggested I did double the dressing.  It made a little extra but that was okay too.  Just bottled it up to keep in the fridge.  I didn't use a regular roque...
7/22/2008,4,I made this for a coworker's baby shower which meant I assembled or cut everything the night before and only saved the pears and avocado for the day of the party.  It was good but I guess I wa...
6/29/2008,4,Was very tasty & filling but I think I may skip the cheese the next time I make it
6/16/2008,4,I subsituted the pecans because all I had on hand were almonds. It tasty for the most part but something about the dressing I didn't care for. I might try and tweak that a bit but I love the o...
6/14/2008,4,Very good I like the sharpness of the blue cheese and the crunch from the pecans.
1/28/2008,4,OMG! This is fantastic! I tweaked it a bit to reduce the sugar and I used a different combination of wine vinegars to make the dressing more to my liking- after trying the original of course. ...
1/21/2008,4,Really yummy!  I substituted almonds for pecans (don't like them) and it was great!
1/16/2008,4,Very good but not 5 star
1/6/2008,4,Very good. Didn't use nearly as much sugar as the recipe called for on the pecans and they were prefect.
11/21/2007,4,this was really delicious and light. I used mixed spring greens rather than lettuce and lightly poached half the pears in a vanilla infused simple syrup. Really nice compliment to a light meal.
8/19/2007,4,The flavor was OK but I did not care for the texture of the avocado mixed with the lettuce.
12/16/2006,4,Excellent salad especially the dressing.  Loved the texture combinations (avocado caramelized pecans) and the green onions were superb.  Would recommend using crumbled cheese if blue isn't you...
11/17/2006,4,LOVE the salad.  I would've given it 5 stars but the lettuce got soggy when I tossed it. Anyone else experience this problem? Maybe next time I'll  just put the dressing on the side.
10/16/2006,4,Very good salad although I did switch a few things.I used the bagged lettuce (spring mix & Romain) used feta cheese insteadand instead of making the dressing I used a raspberry vinagrette - ...
10/5/2006,4,"I made this recipe for my mother's 79th birthday and my picky sons.

They doubted it at first avacado and blue cheese - yuck they said and then tasted it and all loved it!

7/30/2006,4,I think the prepared mustard is too strong in the viniagrette.  I think I will try it again using dijon mustard instead.

4/23/2006,4,Very tasty. We really liked the dressing (I doubled it) and even the avocado was a nice addition. My boyfriend absolutely hated candied pecans and was moodily fishing them out for 15 minutes. Ne...
1/6/2006,4,I used blue cheese because I couldn't find roquefort.  I think it tasted a little funny.  I'll try it again with feta.  I really wanted to love it it seemed like it should taste really good.  I...
1/1/2006,4,This was very good - but can't rave over it the way other reviewers have.  I will make it again - as it was very good - and very easy - but it's not the best salad I've ever had
12/30/2005,4,A wonderful combination of flavors!  However since the presentation may be a little bland with green apples it might be best to use a tart red or blush apple to add color.
12/27/2005,4,Made for Christmas and I really liked and others did but was alot left over.  I think they thought it was okay.  A little disapointed want everyone to rant and rave but maybe its just my looney ...
12/2/2005,4,This was SO good! I served it at Thanksgiving and received several comments on it. Due to time constraints I didn't make the dressing (although I will next time) I used a raspberry hazelnut vin...
8/1/2005,4,omitted onions and receipe was excellent will definately make again!!thanks
7/2/2005,4,My whole family liked this one.  I might omit the avacadoes next time. You could really play around with this one. Loved the dressing.  A great summer or fall salad!
6/28/2005,4,Very good and I'm not a fan of salads OR bleu cheeses. One IMORTANT comment. There is a mistake in the directions. It says to use 1/4 cup of sugar and that isn't right!
5/27/2005,4,My best friend thought it tasted bad. i think that came from me putting too much of the roquefort cheese -- I love bleu cheese so I thought more would be better. Once she mentioned the taste I ...
4/22/2005,4,I liked this recipe alot.  At first when I tasted the dressing alone I was unsure of it and even thought about making a different one but once I tried it with the salad it was a perfect match...

12/23/2004,4,This is a very good salad. However I didn't enjoy the pears and avocados.  The second time I used dried cranberries and omitted the avocado.  It was delicious.  I also added pieces of turkey br...
12/19/2004,4,Made this salad for a Christmas gathering and it was enjoyed by all.  I am not a fan of Blue Vein cheese so next time I will use something else. Will be making this again for Boxing Day BBQ.
11/26/2004,4,I made this salad for our Thanksgiving dinner ths year.  It was perfect for that type of dinner.  I used canned pears because the pears here are not in season right now.  The carmelized pecans m...

11/4/2004,4,The salad was good - I liked the combination of ingredients.  Unfortunately we didn't care for the dressing.  I mixed it up & tasted it before pouring it on.  We decided to skip it and just use...
7/6/2004,4,Very Good! Nice combination of flavors! The only problem I had was in carmelizing the pecans - they stuck to my wax paper even after chilling in the fridge. Perhaps it would be good to spray th...
11/25/2017,3,This salad has too much going on for me. I'd lose the cheese and the nuts. Half of my Thanksgiving guests wouldn't even try it so it went to waste.
9/1/2016,3,Bland - maybe the pears were not sweet enough or it had too much cheese or not enough sugar in dressing.  All great ingredients but needs .....dunno
11/25/2014,3,The salad came out pretty good. I used Gorgonzola cheese which grew on me. My husband tried the salad and just did not like it. But then again he doesn't like anything that looks weird. I would ...
11/1/2014,3,Roquefort wasn't really my thing but overall a good salad. Dressing was a little sweet esp. with the pecans.
8/6/2014,3,Meh.
6/8/2014,3,The salad ingredients worked very well together.  The raw garlic ruined the dressing.
10/22/2013,3,Not tried yet
10/19/2013,3,Is there supposed to be some kind of liquid in the sugar in order to caramelize the pecans? Seems that sugar alone would burn. These online recipes really test my cooking skills. Seems there is ...
4/29/2013,3,It turned out too sweet for me. Since my pears were ripe they were already sweet so I could have used simply roasted pecans and no sugar in the dressing. I didn't notice the mustard at all. Si...
4/14/2013,3,this was definitely something different I just didn't enjoy it.
9/11/2012,3,I added balsamic vinegar to my dressing I would suggest substituting red wine vinegar for balsamic. I also substituted the roquefort cheese for goat cheese. Excellent salad!!!!
3/19/2012,3,Found the cheese to be too overpowering in taste.  Could not taste pear or avocado. Pecans were a nice touch to salad.
1/9/2012,3,I very strongly disliked the flavor of mustard with pear. This salad would be great with a non-mustardy dressing or if the pears were substituted out with something less disgusting with mustard...
10/27/2011,3,This salad had too many flavors going on . My husband and I did not like it at all. I had intended to use this as a Thanksgiving salad this year so thankful I made it in advance. The salad dres...

11/27/2008,3,I was not a fan of the cheese as it was too strong tasting but other than that I thought the recipe was awesome.
6/23/2008,3,This was good but I needed to ad more sugar than stated to the dressing.  I agree with some of the other posters..bacon would be a great added on ingreident.  If I make this again I would add it...
5/31/2008,3,Expected a fantastic salad given the reviews but was not at all impressed.  Jamie's Cranberry Spinach Salad is MUCH better.
2/1/2008,3,Not a fan of blue cheese so I mixed in everything but.  Turned out to be ok - nothing to write home about.  I think even with the blue cheese this salad would still be the same.  Will continue ...
10/23/2006,3,good. but not great. The garlic was a bit strong though I tried to use an average sized clove
7/11/2006,3,This salad was pretty good with a variety of tastes and textures but we didn't care so much for the vinaigrette.  Perhaps some mayonnaise would tone it down a little...
1/22/2006,3,Very good.
12/24/2005,3,It was ok.
11/6/2005,3,you've really got to love blue cheese for this one. i made this for my family and it was recieved with so so reviews. i personally was overwhelmed by the flavors together but in all fairness i...
5/11/2014,2,I didn't try the final product because the pecans got burnt and the pears weren't very tasty but the dressing was too vinegary and odd for my tastes.

12/25/2007,2,I don't know what happened here but I was terribly disappointed in this dressing. I brought this to holiday dinner and it was barely touched (I was pretty embarrassed...) I loved all the other ...
2/1/2012,1,Brilliant
1/19/2012,1,I MADE THIS TONIGHT AND IT WAS SO GOOD I ATE IT FOR MY MEAL.  WHEN I MADE THE DRESSING I USED STRAWBERRY PANCAKE SYRUP INSTEAD OF THE SUGAR. IT WAS SO DELICIOUS.
11/9/2010,1,Strange but in Ukranian household one finds a similar recipe though not of much high quality! For example less pears etc. But not odd how the Soviets do so much better.
12/23/2005,1,Did anyone take a look at the number of calories in this?? Don't make it if you're looking for something healthy or if you're planning to eat other things with your meal in addition to the sala...

6/27/2017,5,Delicious and filling salad.  Will try it with a tuna steak next time and add a bit more black olives..  I used Marie's Lemon Herb dressing and it was good with it.  I thought the leftovers mig...
6/26/2017,5,Hopefully it's not heresy to leave out the olives and add more tomato. I like it better that way.
6/22/2017,5,I make this often. It's a favourite of ours.  To enhance the flavour use tuna packed in oil like they do in Europe!  The flavour in amazing and less canned tasting.  I buy Rio brand at the It...

5/11/2012,5,This was fantastic!  I added an extra Tbl. of capers and left off the onion and anchovy filets just as a personal preference.  I couldn't find a lemon vinaigrette on this site so I used anoth...
10/12/2011,5,Great salad.  I used fresh tuna which I grilled Cajun style.  Served on the side.  Excellent flavour lovely dressing.  High protein meal great if you are on a low card diet.
10/8/2011,5,Perfect recipe! Tastes so fresh and healthy. No changes made to this recipe - definitely will make again!
9/13/2011,5,Healthy with good taste. Took awhile to assemble. Particularly good with fresh tuna.
9/5/2011,5,I followed this recipe exactly except for the green beans and it was excellent. I used the recipe for lemon vinaigrette salad for the dressing and it was perfect.
7/12/2011,5,The women in the family love this dish the men not so much. This is a wonderful dinner after a too hot day. Very refreshing!
1/29/2011,5,Love it!
9/16/2010,5,Love this recipe.  The only change I made to it was I used fresh Ahi Tuna pan seared instead of can tuna.  Very good.
1/5/2010,5,My mother made this salad often when we were growing up and now it is a staple in my house. It is still my favorite salad. My 'meat and potatoes' husband loves this salad. The only difference is...

9/20/2010,4,good salad! I need to find a great dressing to compliment!
9/18/2009,4,Very good & easy to adapt to whatever you have on hand.
8/12/2009,4,Please don't spoil this delightful fresh salad by using canned tuna.  Fresh tuna steak lightly grilled and chopped adds so much more flavor and texture!
10/14/2008,4,My husband loves this salad!
7/14/2008,4,I live in a small town with limited produce options so I blanched asparagus instead of green beans (couldn't find fresh ones).  Perfect!  I cooked a whiting filet instead of using tuna.  Yuck. ...
7/1/2017,3,This recipe doesn't add an important step that makes all the difference.   Once the potatoes and green beans are cooked and sliced they should be marinated in some of the vinaigrette for a few h...

11/8/2007,2,This was just too fishy for me. I also rinsed the tuna beforehand but it was too over powering to me.
8/12/2017,5,Have made several times and always good. Do not use mac nuts but add avocado instead. Serve on crispy sea salt baked crackers with a slice of pickled ginger on top
7/17/2017,5,awesome and simple...did add less soy sauceomitted the nuts & had shallots on hand instead of green onions... thank you!
6/7/2017,5,I was a little apprehensive after trying a store bought sauce the first time but this has a great flavor!
2/20/2017,5,Great recipe. The macadamia nuts are just fine.

10/1/2016,5,EXCELLENT! Love this recipe. Great balance of flavors. Soy can be halved so that you taste more of the tuna.
9/16/2016,5,Could not have been easier .
9/9/2016,5,Easy wife loved it! Simple to make can vary the spices to your taste.
8/10/2016,5,First time I made it I added macadamia nuts. Second time not. Good both ways. We like avocado with ours.  I had a small piece of cucumber that I thinly sliced and added this time. I never mea...

1/14/2016,5,I would like to try with low sodium soy sauce. So glad I know I can make this instead of paying a fortune for it. I used frozen tuna steaks since around here that is all we can find.
12/31/2015,5,This is a very easy and delicious dosh to make for company! My husband and I make this dish every chance we could and the plus side to having this dish is if marinated longer than 2 hrs the fl...
8/19/2015,5,I did omit the nuts reduced the soy sauce until the fish was lightly colored and added chopped nori seaweed.
8/12/2015,5,I love this recipe. I also tried it with less soy but added tomatoes without the seeds and avocado...mmmmmm
8/10/2015,5,I used lower sodium soy sauce and then watered it down even more because I have a problem with too much salt. It still tastes really good to me!
3/17/2014,5,Make it easier on yourself and order the poke sauce in a bottle : Poke King Hawaiian Poke Sauce at Amazon or www.pokesauce.com ...a little spicy !
5/1/2013,5,Made this for a Hawaiian themed get-together and we all RAVED about it. YUM!

8/15/2012,5,added chopped scallops & it was great!
4/30/2012,5,I love ahi poke.  This recipe is silly for suggesting mac nuts I've never heard of that before.  Instead I added a small yellow onion sliced and made sure to use sashimi grade tuna.
3/14/2012,5,Fabulous!!!!! OHHHH my! this was just yummy yummy! I've never done a raw tuna dish like this before. I've eaten dishes that was raw but this was my 1st attempt and I'm in heaven. I totally had ...
8/27/2011,5,Fantastic!

10/6/2009,5,I love ahi poke 'dis da kine brah melts in your mouth ono.  I did add 1/2 teaspoon of wasabi powder for a bite.  The toasted sesame seeds and mac nuts adds a little crunch which I love.  I d...

2/11/2009,5,Love this recipe.  Every time I serve this at a party I always get requests for the recipe.  It taste great served on fried wonton chips and also on toast points.  It's a winner and a keeper.
1/2/2009,5,Loved this!  I didn't have the nuts but didn't miss them - I did add a large tsp of minced ginger (from jar) and it added much flavor.  Also followed other suggestions of cutting soy in half and...
7/27/2008,5,This was awesome!  I made it for a dinner party I had and everyone loved it... including the non-sushi eaters!  I did omit the mac nuts and I used Aloha Shoyu sauce instead of regular soy sauce....
6/13/2008,5,Onolicious! This is the basic shoyu poke style that you see everywhere in Hawaii. There are many different types of poke so keep that in mind when comparing to the traditional Hawaiian poke mad...
4/9/2008,5,Absolutely amazing!  Made it many times
2/9/2008,5,Loved it! Served it with crispy wonton chips.
1/19/2008,5,This is delicious...however I like it a tad better when I use low sodium soy sauce.
12/29/2007,5,Real poke should have some seaweed but I think it's a type that you're not going to find on the mainland (except maybe around SF). This recipe was a fantastic mainland imitation. I would cut ...
12/21/2007,5,Yummy! try with cilantro for a little twist or a kimchee base sauce.
10/23/2007,5,We devoured this.  Tasted like the Poke we got at the Grand Hyatt in Kauai!  Yum!
8/28/2007,5,"I have made this twice now and it has come out great each time.  It is very easy to make and is very tasty.

4/21/2003,5,Terrific!  I followed the recipe exactly and was not at all disappointed - delicious.  I halved the recipe for two people and we still have leftovers.
3/14/2003,5,Excellent for entertaining!  My only recommendation would be to decrease the amount of soy.  the 1st time i made it i used the recipe amount of soy & the soy completely overwhelmed the dish.  Ne...
9/15/2002,5,This is so easy to make and sooo yummy. My friends and family are always asking me for the recipe. Thanks!
3/6/2002,5,This is a *REALLY* good recipe if you like raw fish.  Great easy dinner served with Sushi rice!
12/5/2001,5,FANTASTIC. I would recommend halving the amount of soy so you can enjoy the delicate flavor of the tuna. I used 1/4 cup of soy/teriyaki sauce (for 1 pound of tuna) and it was the perfect amount...
7/22/2001,5,this is really wonderful IF you and your guests like raw fish
1/18/2001,5,YUMMY!  I use to get this at a sushi bar and now I can make it at home!  It's delicious!  Try it over sticky rice!  I took out the macadamia nuts (which I really don't care for) but I added cuc...
12/27/2000,5,This was a great recipe. I didn't use the macadamia nuts or the sesame seeds but instead used some minced garlic.  It turned out like a lot of the hawaiian restaurants in my area.  I love it!!!
10/26/2000,5,Excellent pupu!
6/26/2000,5,This is great!! I have never had this with Macadamia nuts before.

10/7/2016,4,Recipe is pretty good and I would make again but I must remind you to not eat fresh raw fish. Fish must be previously frozen or cooked throughly to kill any parasites. Know this. Live by this....

11/17/2014,4,I was glad to find this recipe. It was a good place to start and get an idea of what I wanted to do with my Poke. I defiantly did not need that much soy sauce and I added some lemon juice sesa...
10/18/2014,4,Great recipe! A bit too much soy sauce. Added  kobiko  ( flying fish roe) and ogo ( hawaiian red sea weed) to give it the traditional Hawaiian flavors. Just like the island poke.

6/29/2012,4,Made it without the nuts because I didn't have them. Still super tasty! Will keep and make again.
9/19/2011,4,This is our go-to poke recipe we always use!  We really enjoy it and it is on our recipe rotation list.
8/5/2011,4,Nice recipe if you halve the soy sauce. Haven't tried it with the macademia nuts.
11/20/2010,4,Having just returned from Hawaii we were still hungry for Ahi Poke which we ate there several times.  I found this recipe and tried it and it was wonderful.  Reducing the soy sauce was a great s...
6/21/2009,4,It's good but some limu is alwase a plus.
12/17/2008,4,Goodbut omit the mac nuts and have wasabi with aloha shoyu on the side.
9/21/2008,4,It was ok next time I'd cut down the red pepper even though I like spicy this ended up too spicy even hubby thought so. Didn't add the nuts
6/27/2008,4,Ahi Poke can be made many different ways.  My favorite Ahi Poke was prepared by a Hawaiian BBQ restaurant.  This recipe is similar to that of the restaurant.  I added ginger (chopped small) whi...
3/26/2008,4,i combined all the ingredients (minus the mac nuts) before i poured the mixture onto the tuna.  i ended up using about 2/3 of everything.  i definitely would agree with others that said to use l...
5/12/2007,4,Oh so yummy! I used fresh wasabi paste instead of the crushed red pepper for heat and also added diced avocado to make the poke even more silky and rich.

9/15/2002,4,Yummy! I ommitted the macadamia nuts but all in all it was pretty good! 1 cup of soy sauce was a bit too much as well as the 3/4 cup of green onions so i reduced it. But if you're a sashimi lov...
8/13/2001,4,This was a delicious recipe!  Be sure to use very fresh good tuna though!  I cooked the leftovers on skewers the next day and it was flaky and lovely.
1/16/2016,3,added a little shallot used spicy garlic chili paste instead of dry flake no nuts. Served on a Triscuit with sharp white cheddar. Would like the sauce to be thicker to coat. ideas?
6/28/2015,3,Basic! That explains this recipe. I made it as the recipe said to give it a fair review. For me there isn't enough depth of flavor there. It needed a lot less soy sauce more sesame oil garlic...
5/30/2010,3,As well as dropping the macadamia nuts I use SHOYU - a less salty & more flavorable style of soy sauce.  I find SHOYU in my local Asian markets.
4/20/2006,3,Tasty and not too fishy.  Nice texture.
7/27/2011,2,hawaii808 is right. I have  had lots of poke and it is not soupy or runny at all. A full cup of shoyu would really be too much. I have never had it with mac nuts either. The key it a balance of ...
2/13/2016,1,It was mushy and way too salty.

11/28/2012,4,Great use of things I had on hand.  I was surprised by how mild the tuna was.  I added salt pepper crushed red pepper as suggested by other reviewers.

7/23/2010,4,I didn't think it had enough sauce next time I will cut the amount of pasta by half. I also added dried basil I thought the sauce was too bland with just oregano and thyme. I used whole grain ...
1/18/2009,4,I followed the recipe quite closely although I sauted the onion by itself first.  A tasty recipe but it might benefit from a touch of chili.  If anyone tries chili please report back!
11/15/2008,4,I loved this recipe. I added cilantro for topping and substituted canned crab for the tuna and it turned out delicious! I plan to make this again soon.
1/21/2013,3,"I thought this was okay. It could use some punching up. Perhaps some briney salty black olives. 

I was surprised at how well the tuna worked."
12/6/2008,3,Added canellini and only used one can of tuna. Used diced tomatoes. Pretty darn good for a meal when you are broke!

7/26/2014,3,Husband didn't like it. :(
8/13/2012,3,The recipe is a great start for calabacitas. I sauteed the onions & bell pepper for a bit then added the rest of the veggies. Next time I will make it without the bell pepper.
7/26/2011,3,I didn't like this very much when made as the recipe states.  I added some spices salt garlic powder and season salt also used jalapenos instead of the green pepper.  I agree that the amount ...

2/8/2007,2,I thought this was just okay. Too much cheese and runny.
8/30/2005,2,This was a watery gloppy mess.  It was like vegetable soup with globs of cheese in it.  Although it tasted OK I will not make this again.
9/14/2017,5,It was a hit with the family.  I used beef broth instead of water adjusted the spices.  I served it with Kraft Mexican cheese  tomato  green onion and avocado.
4/4/2017,5,"Amazing dish. I used the ingredients as a base with ground turkey and added/replaced a couple things. I also eyeballed the seasonings I didn't measure out anything. It came out great.

I like ..."
10/18/2016,5,I have finally found THE recipe for ground beef in tacos.  Throughout the years I have made tacos using ground beef and one of those seasoning packets.  The results weren't awful but it wasn't...
10/7/2014,5,These tacos got me motivated to make my own.
9/19/2014,5,I was quite pleased with this recipe.  I didn't read the directions before starting and just assumed I should brown the beef.  So I browned  & drained the beef then added the seasonings pepper...
9/10/2014,5,What a great alternative to the packet!  I love the seasonings for this beef filling.  I use an entire onion and pepper and do add a little chipotle powder for smokiness along with 2/3 cup lo...

7/23/2014,5,These were so much better than your average homemade tacos.  A little more time consuming to make but worth it.
7/6/2014,5,I made this for a large group of 30+ increased to over 10 pounds of beef. I added more spices and jazzed it up a bit. Kept meat warm in Dutch Ovens setting on bed of coals. Set it up on large ou...
6/13/2014,5,Made exactly per the recipe and it is wonderful. I personally would omit the garlic powder but other than that it is a winner. Authentic version of a classic American dish- my mom is from New M...

10/25/2009,5,I halved the recipe for just the two of us and it was perfect.  I think I may leave out the bell pepper next time and up some of the spices.  Made wonderful tacos with my Mexican Rice II from th...
7/24/2009,5,This turned out great! If you think the seasoning is on the bland side just up the amounts a bit. I made this a day ahead of time and let the meat soak in the broth and fat. I wouldn't recommen...
2/23/2009,5,Fantastic meat for Tacos! WOW no more taco seasoning packets for us! I put this in the crock pot and cooked for 2 1/2 hrs. I wanted more heat so I added 1 1/2 tsp. crushed red pepper. This re...

1/25/2008,5,Exactly what I wanted in a taco meat--I'd only had the dry-fried packaged-seasoning kind before.  This is so much better!  And since I was only feeding myself and my husband I had plenty lefto...
1/21/2008,5,These tacos tasted just like my favorite Mexican restaurants!  I'll be making them again!
12/22/2007,5,Awesome...I just recently moved to Canada from the States and there are no Mexican restaurants to be found.  Thank goodness I can get my fix anytime right in my own kitchen!!
12/16/2007,5,This makes the best taco meat ever. My Family loves it as I have searched for just the perfect authentic recipe forever. I think by cooking the meat for so long makes the texture and flavor comb...
11/22/2007,5,This recipe was awesome ! I used extra lean ground beef thus saving the time to remove the fat after cooking. The added onions and bell peppers made for a delicious taco dinner. We are from the ...
11/6/2007,5,This is a great recipe for ground beef tacos.  The beef got so soft.  I served with mexican rice and refried beans recipes that I got here too.  It was a very good meal.
10/4/2007,5,"This was amazing!
I only made 1 lb so I halved all of the ingredients.  I added the juice of half a lime to give it that extra mexican zip.
Also I used extra lean ground beef and didn't drain i..."
9/14/2007,5,Great!  Very flavorful.  My rent smelled wonderful while the meat was simmering.  Fresh tomatoes from my garden topped it off.
6/27/2007,5,I finally figured out how restaurants get their taco meat so yummy-boiling it!! I've always cooked mine in the pan with blah results. I love the fine soft texture of the meat cooked like this. ...
3/2/2007,5,Very authentic! I didn't realize it when I started this recipe that it's time consuming so I started it one night & finished the next. Used lean ground beef. It's delicious. Use the authentic ch...
2/20/2007,5,I really loved this! Im not a fan of the seasoning packets for taco meat and have been looking for a recipe that doesn't taste like it...well I have found my new taco recipe! Very good!!!!!

1/3/2006,5,Mmmmm...these are authentic TexMex tacos indeed. They were very very good. These aren't spicy or not at all like the dried package taco mix tacos this is more subtle just like you'll get in an...
7/24/2005,5,Very moist and tasty!  I added 4 cloves of fresh garlic along with the garlic powder.  I added most of the juices back into the meat after the fat was removed and the spices were perfect!  My hu...
7/2/2005,5,This was VERY good.  I've eaten many times in Matamoros and Progresso Mexico (Garcia's and Angel's restaurants) and this IS what it tastes like.  I doubled the recipe for a party of 7.  Everyone...

After reading the reviews I decided to use onl..."
10/2/2016,4,good recipe except it needed more salt - we put Adobo seasoning in it.  Not sure if that means we are a salt-addicted family but it needed it.  Everything else was great.
12/31/2015,4,The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of a million is that it takes SO LONG... but totally worth it!! my family LOVES it - and so do I which is why I keep making it!
5/9/2014,4,So good it should be illegal. I used twice the onion which worked great.
8/4/2013,4,SO good! My hubs requested tacos for dinner tonight. I remembered stumbling upon this recipe a couple of week's ago thinking the preparation method seemed unique and wanting to give it a try. I...
3/22/2012,4,I used a red bell pepper instead of green and I increased both the amounts of the bell pepper and the onion to whole instead of half. I also did NOT use the full amount of salt just enough to t...
5/14/2009,4,I thought this was a decent way to make taco meat.  Someone else on this site talked about cooking your ground beef in water for some other recipes.  I will probably make this again.  Thanks for...
2/5/2009,4,Very Good. I will have to do some tweaking next time. As it was a little bland. I am thinking it could use some chipotle peppers in it while cooking.
1/3/2009,4,Great addition to our Mexican feast! Will definitely make again.
12/28/2008,4,This was a good recipe though I had to add extra seasoning and a little salsa  too it to bring flavor to it
10/11/2008,4,I thought this was ok.
9/10/2008,4,Very good liked the flavor.
6/27/2008,4,Good but REALLY mild. I'm not a fan of hot spicy food and it was even too mild for me!
3/19/2008,4,Well my son said its the BOMB so do I need to say anymore.  It does take some more time but worth it.  I am trying to get away from the prepackage items because of sodium.  I will make this ...
2/6/2008,4,very good!  i used it to fill gorditas.  next time i think i'll add some diced potato to the mix.  authentic mexican flavor--thanks!
10/11/2007,4,I would have given this a five star if I didnt have to change it so much.  I added 1/4 cup chopped onion 1 large roma tomato chopped 1/3 cup of corn (our personal fav version) and salt pepp...
4/12/2007,4,This is so yummy! and just like the taco meat I used to eat as a kid.  I have been wanting a taco meat recipe like this for a long time.  I made it with half beef half venison and used 2 tsp of...
4/12/2007,4,Some of us thought it needed more pizazz.  Some loved it.
4/21/2017,3,As it is written I would rate it 3 stars (I'm not a fan of the boiling method). What I actually did was brown the beef and added the spices and onion as called for. I also added lemon and lime j...
8/2/2012,3,Very easy to prepare but isn't very special. Tastes ok.
12/2/2010,3,I thought these were just okay.  They were very soft but they just didnt have much flavor to me.  I added about a 1/4 teaspoon extra of the seasonings which helped a little but not much.  We ate...
2/20/2010,3,good...I added ALOT more of the spices just based on my preference...I love the idea of the simmering...gives it great texture and really lets the flavor set in...I won't be buying taco seasonin...
7/10/2009,3,With a few adjustments to the seasonings this turned out great. I browned the meat a little before adding the water. I debated whether or not to add a can of tomato sauce to the mix. I didn't ...
9/26/2008,3,This was OK.  I liked simmering the beef mixture all day but felt like the spices weren't enough and ended up adding another Tablespoon of taco seasoning to give it enough flavor for my tastes....
8/31/2008,3,This was okay but not worth all the time it took to cook the meat skim the fat etc. It was somewhat better than making tacos with the packaged taco seasoning but for what little difference t...
4/6/2008,3,Made this for dinner a few nights ago and had to throw the rest away!  This was ok but very bland.  Tacos are usually very popular in my house but no one wanted seconds of this.  I'll stick to...
1/7/2008,3,Needed a lot more seasoning.  Had to add saltpepper and hot sauce.  Like the broth however.  Used it the next day.
7/14/2007,3,Good but flavor is nothing special.
1/5/2017,2,Poured all the flavour out with the juices. Bland and tasteless.
5/18/2015,2,Very boring. I like the consistency but the meat had very little flavor. I even use quality spices from Penzey's. I won't bother to try it again.
3/19/2014,2,For the amount of spices I put in it was very bland. I did like the texture of the meat simmering in water.  I think this could be a very good recipe with some adjustments.
3/6/2008,2,uh no this is *not* authentic-tasting.  i grew up in deep south texas then lived in laredo for 5 (long) years. with all the rave reviews i thought i was in for a treat and ditched my own way...
2/16/2008,2,Bland bland BLAND!  Also hated the texture of the meat.  Followed the recipe exactly and couldn't get myself to eat seconds.  I threw the rest away.
7/21/2005,2,If this is what authentic tacos taste like then I will stick with the fake ones because I like flavor. When the meat and seasonings simmered in water for an hour all of the potential flavor ...
11/23/2017,5,Followed the recipe except I froze the Brie for an hour as other reviewers did turned out great.  The way you add the filling to the two halves allows you to get more filling in so I would reco...
11/16/2017,5,Yummy!  Will absolutely make this again.  Everyone at the party raved about it.  Especially loved the video which showed how to make the decorative grapes on the vine w/ the puff pastry and the ...
10/22/2017,5,I was amazed at how my guests loved this.  One told me he didn't care for walnuts cranberries or brie but he loved this.  Am making it a second time for company tonight.
8/12/2017,5,Delicious as per recipe and yummy to add  a bit of wildflower honey drizzled over the walnuts.
5/21/2017,5,Simple and excellent with Melba toast!

2/17/2017,5,I will definitely make this again. It was a hit when I made it for a get together with friends. Made it according to the recipe.
2/10/2017,5,This was our very first experience with brie so it is hard to evaluate it. We did not expect the salty taste of the brie but I think the cranberries and walnuts helped counteract that. It isn't...
1/10/2017,5,This turned out excellent and was easy to do. Looks very elegant with puff pastry cut outs. Will make again!

12/28/2016,5,Everyone seemed to love it. Good Christmas appetizer. I cut with a knife. Make sure your cheese is fresh it turns out better. I used a pastry roll which was much better than using the cresent r...
12/27/2016,5,I have made baked Brie many times. I followed the recipe as written. This one was by far the best! Great work Chef John.
12/26/2016,5,Big hit for Christmas Eve! This was so easy and elegant. I did use the tooth floss technique to cut my brie in half it was perfect!  I made it ahead of time and froze it then just followed Che...
12/26/2016,5,This was awesome we will make this again and again.

12/25/2016,5,Chef John does not disappoint on his humorous videos or delicious recipes. I didn't have to use the string technique as a knife worked well. Of all the items on my buffet table this was the item...
12/23/2016,5,no
12/20/2016,5,Yummy. Was a hit at a Xmas party with people asking how to make it. Very easy and even when cools down nice to eat without crackers just in the pastry.
12/17/2016,5,Yummy and super easy!! I used dates instead of cranberries. Also I just cut the cheese with the knife with no problem.
12/12/2016,5,I made  for a dinner party and I was  hit! I put it together and put  in the freezer for a while. lowered the temp to 400 and added 5-10 min. I also used a cookie cutter to make a Christmas tre...
12/12/2016,5,I used a refrigerated pie crust (because that it what I had) and it was amazing!  Followed everything else exactly... RAVE reviews!
12/7/2016,5,Was a big hit at our family's thanksgiving gathering. Used dried cranberries and honey as filling and excluded nuts since many of my nephews aren't big on gourmet nuts. Had considered using cas...
12/1/2016,5,Didn't quite know how to score it so I cut the top into four sections half way down folded back the top layers and stuffed in the cranberries and nuts - it was sooooo good.
11/25/2016,5,Everyone loved it.....it was gone in about 20 minutes.  I didn't have puff pastry so I used a store bought pie crust (the kind that come in a roll) and it turned out fine.  I will definitely mak...
9/18/2016,5,This turned out great. It looks fancy but it's really very easy to make! A great way to impress guests at a holiday party... Thanks Chef John! =)
5/21/2016,5,What a beautiful  gem to star in my bunco buffet! I used an 8 oz wheel (small enough to just set it on its edge and cut with a large knife) I used sliced almonds (not slivered) to make it less ...
3/27/2016,5,Crowd pleaser! I did not do the string technique. I put the brie wheel in the freezer for about 20 minutes and was able to cut it in half with a knife with no problems.
10/14/2017,4,I also did not bother with the string bit to slice the Brie in half.  20 minutes in the freezer & it was easy to cut.  I also didn't follow the instructions for the nuts and cranberries.  I put ...
12/20/2016,4,Pretty good. It was very pretty. However we always cook a recipe the first time exactly as written. This one did not seem hot enough inside when done outside. So it needs a little modification o...
11/26/2017,5,It was amazing. I took the other suggestions and only used 1 cup of sugar. It was perfect.
11/11/2017,5,Let me start by saying I've NEVER liked eggnog. But last year for Xmas I wanted to make something different with some booze in it. Found this recipe and OH. MY. GOD. This was so good. Made a b...
10/28/2017,5,Instead of light cream I used 2 cups heavy cream + 2 cups half & half. For the rum Captain Morgan's spiced. I used all 12 yolks and didn't have any problems with milk curdling or eggs cooking. ...
10/3/2017,5,Absolutely delicious! I never want to buy storebought eggnog anymore.

1/10/2017,5,We made it without the rum.  It  was very thick and delicious.
12/31/2016,5,This is THE best eggnog. I did not add the rum. It tastes fantastic all on its own. If I  want rum I will add one oz to a full glass of eggnog and top it with more nutmeg.
12/31/2016,5,Without a doubt the BEST eggnog I've ever made or tasted.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Creamy and fresh and just delicious.  My family loved this.  I will be making this every year!  Thank y...

12/29/2016,5,Love this recipe. You don't need to place in the fridge overnight neither do you have to add cream or rum
12/28/2016,5,Alcohol was strong at first for me but I'm drinking it on day 5 and it tastes much better aged. Overall really good recipe the ingredients come together perfectly
12/28/2016,5,Turned out awesome. I reduced the recipe to 4 servings because it was only for a couple people and I used Malibu coconut rum instead of light rum. Absolutely delicious and a very easy recipe. ...

12/20/2016,5,Absolutely delicious. Classic.  Easy and well worth the cooking and cooling time.
12/19/2016,5,Very good eggnog.   I did cut the sugar by %25 and next time will cut the cinnamon a little bit too.  This is a great eggnog for the holidays.
12/18/2016,5,5 stars with my changes!!! I used 1 vanilla bean 2 cinnamon sticks and 3 cloves to simmer in the milk.  then I used half  heavy cream and half half n half for the cream part and I used 1 cup of...

12/10/2011,5,Be very careful when you're bringing the milk mixture to a boil in the beginning - it only need to  JUST boil or it might curdle!!  Also we whisked the egg yolks and the sugar in the kitchenai...
12/10/2011,5,Excellent! I have made 4 gallons (yes gallons!) this year for different events and it came out great! This recipe is very forgiving. You can adjust the sweetness as you need to. I also omitted t...
12/1/2011,5,"Seriously the best eggnog. I don't usually enjoy eggnog but I cannot get enough of this stuff!

My only suggestions wou..."
11/29/2011,5,I just finished preparing the mixture. Before refrigerating I poured a small glass for my husband (who hates Eggnog) to try.  I figured that if he hated it I could play with the recipe a littl...
11/18/2011,5,I doubled the spices and quartered the rum and it was perfect
11/14/2011,5,Great recipe!!! I so love store bought eggnog but am cutting back on fat.........So I used this recipe & put in 2% milk & fat free half & half. It was still good. Not as good as the real recip...

I'm a wimp when it comes to boiling milk but other than that it's actually not too hard. I also agree with the previous comment about tempering the egg..."
11/1/2011,5,Very yummy egg nog! I love egg nog and I love this egg nog. I made without the rum. Next time I will play around with the spices to give it a little more kick.
10/21/2011,5,This would've been excellent had I not scorched it! I added heavy whipping cream to it which made it nice and creamy...unfortunately I scorched it while handleling my little baby.
10/6/2011,5,This eggnog is AMAZING!!! I've never made homemade eggnog and I won't have to search for any other recipe! Seriously... WOW!!! I don't use the rum. And its amazing without it :D
6/8/2011,5,My son is always asking why I didn't buy eggnog (in the middle of summer) so I can't tell you how happy I am to have found this recipe!  My cloves were a little old so I decided to use pumpkin p...

2/4/2011,5,This eggnog is just the best! I'm from Belgium and eggnog is not known in our country but it is too good not to have it available. And now we can make our own it's even better.

1/17/2011,5,excellent taste. My husband and I are not much for alcohol so in the future I would use less but otherwise this recipe is delicious!

1/13/2011,5,I will never be able to drink store bought after making this. It is so delicious!  I cut the rum in half and I thought it made for the perfect amount of rum.  Any more would have been too strong...
1/11/2011,5,Wow...I made this for the first time over the holidays and lets just say it has been nicknamed orgasmic egg nog!  AMAZING!  That's all I have to say.
1/9/2011,5,Made this Christmas! Was absolutely wonderful! My 80 year old grandfather said it's the best he's ever had! Has a custard flavour! Superb!!!!!!
1/6/2011,5,perfect eggnog...i make this every year its not too think like some
1/4/2011,5,This was AWESOME. I had to made another batch because the first one was emptied within minutes. I made it per the ingredients minus the rum (had a lot of non drinkers) and it came out great.
1/1/2011,5,I made this for the first time this past holiday...WOW!!!  DELICIOUS!!!  Easy to make too.  ( I did add about 1/2 cup extra half and half.)
1/1/2011,5,After reading the other reviews I decided to leave the rum out of the recipe then mix it in to taste when the eggnog was served.  I used just a small amount of rum in mine and thought it tasted...
12/31/2010,5,liked alot used to many cloves (on accident) and half and half instead of light cream (i told my husband what to buy and he brought home the wrong thing) and no rum. still very good.
12/30/2010,5,I made this twice over the holidays. It got rave reviews. I personally found it too sweet but everyone else liked it as is so I will continue to make this recipe exactly as written.
12/29/2010,5,This is a great eggnog recipe. I made exactly as stated and it turned out great! I will be using this again for sure:)
12/29/2010,5,very very good even without the rum.
12/27/2010,5,That's what I'm talkin' about.  The only problem is having it refrigerate overnight.  What a tease!
12/27/2010,5,We made two batches of this...one alcoholic and one without alcohol.  We decreased the amount of alcohol in half and found it was still a little too strong for us.  But that is just our preferen...
12/26/2010,5,Outstanding!!  I did not add rum.  I had some Godiva Chocolate Liqueur I added to each glass of those who wanted it spiked.  A new holiday tradition is born!!!  Thank you Nataliesmom!!

12/24/2010,5,Really delicious and tastes just like I've always remembered.
12/24/2010,5,I used 2 cups of run based on all of the other reviewers that complained it was too strong. I still tasted the rum but it wasn't too overpowering. Tasted great thanks!
12/24/2010,5,Fantastic!! I followed many of the other reviews and definatly cut the sugar back to alittle less than a cup. Also only half of the rum is needed. We're drinkers and the whole amount this recipe...
12/24/2010,5,I made this recipe exactly as shown and it is wonderful.  I will never again consume store-bought egg nog.  I will however serve the alcohol on the side as an option.
12/24/2010,5,The recipe was very good! I made 2 batches so the children can enjoy but switched the rum to Bailey's and added a pinch of salt. It seemed to be missing that little bit of bite. Thanks for shar...

12/20/2010,5,I substituted 1/2 t. ground cloves for the 5 whole cloves.  Straining is still a good idea if you want to get rid of possible clumps.  I added all the vanilla and nutmeg after cooking and before...

12/13/2010,5,The flavor is great but came out chunky?  I have tiny little chunk the size of pin heads.  Maybe I'm a pinhead and just cooked it wrong.
12/12/2010,5,very good if you like eggnog (I don't but everyone at my party did.) i used fat free half and half instead of the cream to lighten it up and lessen the calorie count a bit and the taste was s...

12/2/2010,5,OMG!  I will never buy eggnog in the store again!  I omitted the rum so that my kids can have this as well.  I did take the advice to cut the vanilla to 1 tsp at the end (though I love vanilla a...

12/23/2009,5,Loved it!!
12/23/2009,5,This came out quite delicious!  I used skim milk and cream and it still came out a little creamy and thick for our taste.  The flavor is wonderful though!  Next time I'll use half and half inste...
12/22/2009,5,Amazing eggnog. I didn't add the rum that the recipe called for and my grocery store was out of light cream so I used heavy whipping cream. It was still wonderful. Unfortunately this means th...
12/22/2009,5,Best eggnog my husband and I have EVER had!  I used the recipe for 6 servings.  Cut the sugar down to 1/2 C instead of 3/4 C.  Didn't add the rum so people could add to personal taste.  Next tim...
12/22/2009,5,This was easy to make and very good! I made this without the Rum tasted great!
12/21/2009,5,Fabulous recipe! I didn't change any of the ingredients however I did change some of the prep steps. I put the milk mixture on the stove for 5 minutes on low 2 minutes on the next setting and ...
12/20/2009,5,This is a VERY easy recipe.  I made it as is...no changes. It is wonderful without being refridgerated overnight...I had to taste before I put it in the fridge and I will be drinking some in a f...
12/20/2009,5,This past Christmas is the third time I have made this eggnog.  It is divine.  I cut the recipe in half and leave out the rum so that it can be added to individual servings.  This keeps quite a ...
12/20/2009,5,this was delicious!! I used spiced rum instead of light rum
12/18/2009,5,Excellent!  I don't really drink eggnog so I don't have much to compare it to.  However when I gave it to my boyfriend his first reaction was It's different... it doesn't really taste like ...
12/18/2009,5,Excellent though I found that I needed only half the amount of rum.  It sure packs a punch with the full amount I'd be on the floor!  LOL!  Ran out of cream and used condensed milk instead..d...
12/18/2009,5,I don't like eggnog but I have to admit it didn't taste bad.  My husband and son big eggnog fans loved it.
12/16/2009,5,My first attempt trying to make anything like this. It took a little time but was well worth the effort. Next time I will omit the rum so the kids can try it and others can adjust the potency ...
12/15/2009,5,Ok I have never left a review but this stuff was so good I had to write. Made both a leaded and unleaded version for our Christmas Bunko group and both got rave reviews! The only change I ...
12/14/2009,5,Wow!  I made this recipe for my cookie exchange party over the weekend and it was the first thing to go. I was surprised at how easy this recipe was to make and everyone said it was MUCH better ...
12/14/2009,5,Love this recipe! I am requested to make it every year for Christmas Eve. The recipe is easy and fun.
12/12/2009,5,Excellent. Perfect as written. If some reviewers wanted thicker eggnogg then perhaps this wasn't  for the recipe for them in the first place -- but instead of slamming it they should just fin...
12/11/2009,5,This was eggcellent !!
12/11/2009,5,Absolute perfection in a glass!  Yes it's time consuming but so worth it.
12/11/2009,5,This eggnog is great! I live in China... not exactly the land of eggnog. My husband loved this recipe. We can only get full cream here so I substitute whole milk for 1/2 of the cream. We also le...
12/10/2009,5,FANTASTIC! i made this for a party and it was a huge hit! I used skim milk and half-and-half and I tempered the eggs with the hot milk mixture a little at a time. I didn't add any rum to the ac...
12/8/2009,5,Oh. My. Goodness.  This is heavenly!  I know that the holidays are busy and the last thing I need is another item on my to do list but...  I think I'm going to have to make this eggnog a Chr...
12/8/2009,5,I'm actually just finishing off a glass of this as a I type this review. Made it yesterday and I must say this egg nog is spectacular especially after you let it chill over night! Highly recom...
12/7/2009,5,I did all 1% milk instead of cream. Omitted Rum so people can add as they want (or not.) Soooo good.
12/7/2009,5,Loved it.  I was paranoid about cooking my egg yolks and wound up ladling in small amounts of milk with my right hand while keeping the hand mixer going with my left.  I ended up with a big pile...
12/5/2009,5,I used skim milk and then homogenized instead of the milk/cream and it was still fantastic! I didn't use Rum because it's for my kids but the rest of the recipe I followed exactly. Sooooooo good...
12/2/2009,5,I followed this recipe almost exactly but left out the cloves because I don't particularly like their flavor. Also as I am pregnant I used 1tbs of artificial rum flavor extract instead of act...
11/29/2009,5,Eggnog is one of the scarce few things I have always been intimidated by.  I made this wed night before thanksgiving.  When I woke up the next morning the guys had drank it all.  (before 7am) I...
11/25/2009,5,It really IS amazing eggnog. It tastes just like my favourite store-bought kind if not better. No one in my family drinks alcohol so to get the flavour I substituted 2 tsp rum extract instead ...
11/25/2009,5,I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe. Thanks for sharing! To any of you who may make the same mistake I did (I let the egg mixture get a little too hot and I almost had scrambled eggnog) there is a ...
11/23/2009,5,Extremely good eggnog. I am not normally a huge fan of the stuff but I have family who loves it. The brand that is their favorite isn't available where I live and the ones that were at the sto...
11/21/2009,5,I've made this twice and all I can say is WOW!  I never liked store bought eggnog but I made this for my husband and to test out for a Christmas party I will be hosting in a few weeks.  I've ...
11/21/2009,5,Read as many of the reviews of this as you have time for..two things that readers said actually worked for this recipe are true: 1) if your milk curdles put the mixture in the blender - it curdl...
11/3/2009,5,WOW!  My husband loves eggnog and he actually gave this recipe a wow that's good.  Even someone here who doesn't really like eggnog enjoyed this very much.  So much better than store bought! ...
10/31/2009,5,I made this last year for Christmas dinner with the whole family. I left out the rum so the little ones could enjoy it to. This was sooooo good. Everyone loved it! I will definately be making th...
10/29/2009,5,Perfect just as it is!!!
10/28/2009,5,used 1 table spoon of rum extract instead of rum and it was very good  I will not buy store bought ever again
10/10/2009,5,I will never buy eggnog again!  This is to die for!!  I can't thank you enough for this recipe.  It has been a wonderful addition to our Christmas tradition.
8/31/2009,5,I used this recipe Dec./08 and everyone loved it. I will use it again this yearI did cut back on the rum.
6/12/2009,5,I love this recipe! However I did ever-so-slightly cut down on the sugar & the vanilla and love love love it this way. Oh - and I make mine without rum - tastes great if you're wondering how it...
2/24/2009,5,Soooo delicious. A lot of work but it's sooo good. Made it for a Christmas gathering and everyone loved it!
1/25/2009,5,Very Rich and smooth! The spices mesh well together...no rum needed!!
1/18/2009,5,Awesome recipe.  I didn't have whole cloves so I used 1/2 tsp of ground cloves instead.  Still works...yum!
1/14/2009,5,AWESOME! i want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for this recipe. my mother is dying from cancer and loves eggnog. you can't buy it after the holidays so i needed a recipe and this one ...
1/9/2009,5,So the negative reviews almost scared me away but after I read If you don't like this recipe you don't like eggnog. I decided to give it a shot and they were RIGHT! I followed suggestions of...

1/2/2009,5,Delicous omg i made this old years night and was surprised mat how quick and easy it was. I didnt use rum because i dont drink but it was smoethe creamy and delicious. I will not wait until the...
1/1/2009,5,Fantastic! I made two batches one with rum and one without and I liked the virgin version better. Thank you for the recipe it was one of the highlights of my New Year's Eve dinner!
12/28/2008,5,got very drunk lol
12/26/2008,5,I wasn't sure what light cream was so we used regular whipping cream.  It was way to thick and I had to thin it with more milk.  Next time I will use half and half.  I also halved the Rum.  Oth...
12/26/2008,5,The name says it all.  AMAZINGLY GOOD!  I made this for our family Christmas party and everybody loved it.  To make the eggnog kid-friendly I used 2 tsp. of rum flavoring and omitted the rum.  T...
12/25/2008,5,Absolutely Amazing! I made 4 batches of this and tried it with and without Rum ...both ways it is splendid just as the recipe calls. If you don't love THIS recipe you don't love Eggnog it's a...
12/24/2008,5,great recipe delicious!!!
12/23/2008,5,This egg nog was gooood...I had some spills while I was bottling it and my daughter was licking it all up! I will make this again and again..I skipped cooking over medium heat for 3 minutes and ...
12/23/2008,5,I was nervous about how this would turn out.  I followed instructions to the T with the exception of using less rum.  I used 1 1/2 cups of Captain Morgan's Spiced Rum and the taste turned out ab...
12/23/2008,5,I have never like eggnog but this changed my mind.  It is the only way I will drink it now!
12/22/2008,5,This eggnog was delicious with two caveats - the first time I made it I was tasting it quite a bit before adding the rum which actually ended up making it undrinkable. I ended up dumping it...
12/21/2008,5,it was perfect next time I will double the recipe.
12/19/2008,5,I am NOT an eggnog person by any means.  I made this recipe to help a friend prepare for a party and as soon as I took the first sip--I loved it.  Every person who drank some has converted to b...
12/19/2008,5,This was my first time ever making eggnog. I was upset last night when I made it and I didn't read the recipe properly. I mixed the cream with the milk in the beginning of the recipe. Oh well. I...
12/16/2008,5,This egg nog is amazing! I used 750ml of white rum which is slightly more than the recipe called for but it didn't come out tasting too strong. We also inadvertently used skim milk as that is wh...
12/14/2008,5,This is to die for!!  Made it without any rum and added more milk and cream to make it a little less rich. . .so we could have more in one serving.  Tastes like a spice milkshake but rich and ...
12/14/2008,5,So yummy! I omitted the rum. After I tempered the eggs with about 1c. of the hot milk I stirred it back in and kept stirring the 3 minutes then strained right away. No problem with curdling co...
12/14/2008,5,This was my first attempt at homemade eggnog and it was awesome.  Like another reviewer I saved half the egg whites beat them until stiff peaks formed and then stirred that into the mixture.  ...
12/13/2008,5,"Only added 1 C of bacardi rum and it was PERFECT!!!!!
Also at the end added 1 tsp of vanilla plus 1/2 of fresh vanilla pod"
12/9/2008,5,This is absolutely delicious!!! I did not have a problem with the eggs curdling I just followed the directions to the T and it turned out wonderfully!! The only thing I didn't like is that it...
12/8/2008,5,"Who in their right mind can wait 24 hours to drink this?  I only made 1/2 of the recipe but wish I'd made the whole recipe! 
YUMMMMMMMMMY!!!!!"
12/6/2008,5,This is the best recipe for eggnog I have found. I will no longer be looking for other recipes... I used this last year and added rum flavoring instead of the light rum because I was pregnant......
12/5/2008,5,"amazing!
it was the first time i made eggnog so i made only 1\4 of the recipe... i didn't have rum so i used brendy. it was a bit too much for me... 
defenetly going to make it on christmas!"
12/5/2008,5,This is excellent! I made it without the cloves because I didn't have any and a little less rum but it was great!
12/5/2008,5,I made this once to see how it would turn out. It turned out great! Only thing that I didn't follow  was that I used half and half instead of the light cream... Mine did curdle like others sugg...
12/2/2008,5,I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit.  I doubled it except the eggs.  The result was great.  The kids hated eggnog before because they thought it was too thick.  Also I used Heavy ...
11/29/2008,5,This is the best Egg Nog recipe I have found yet.  The best prep method too most other ones I've tried mixed the milk and egg to start which made it twice as hard to not heat it too quickly.  I...
11/29/2008,5,Made this for an eggnog-loving friend and he loved it! used 1 1/2 tsp ground cloves 2 tsp of rum and 10 eggs instead and still turned out well.
11/26/2008,5,My husband's comment was that this eggnog was just like store-bought!  It's not exactly what I was hoping to hear but he adores store-bought eggnog so it was a compliment.  He told me to give ...
11/7/2008,5,I cant tell you enough how GREAT this recipe was I have been wanting to make homemade eggnog for several years now but concerned of the time involved and wasted ingredients if it turned out po...
10/19/2008,5,I love it! it really is an amazingly good eggnog!
9/20/2008,5,My husband has requested this every Christmas and New Year's Day. Big hit at each party.
8/28/2008,5,My son loves eggnog (or 'eggnock' as he says it!) and I love eggnog lattes so this is our go-to recipe since we can't buy eggnog off-season.  I have made this recipe at least 3 times (sans rum ...
7/13/2008,5,"You will never buy store bought again!!!!
It is somewhat labor intensive but well worth the effort. My co-workers start hounding me in October with their requests. I make it by the gallon durin..."
6/4/2008,5,I made this eggnog for a Christmas party a few years ago and it was amazing! Ever since I've always had request to bring a batch. The only change I would make is the amount of rum used... I'd ...
4/22/2008,5,I made this for Christmas and it was fantastic! The only thing I would do differently is make it the night before - it really is best when chilled overnight. It's now a Christmas recipe keeper!
4/21/2008,5,Incredible!!!! I am never making any other eggnog again! I have been making homemade eggnog for years as I have been living in europe for the last 10 years and this has got to be the best reci...
4/11/2008,5,Very nice and thick eggnog.  Not something to drink everyday but a nice splurge!  I had a bit of trouble with it curdling on me (my fault - I let it get too hot) but a quick spin in the blende...
3/30/2008,5,We loved this recipe but I only used half the amount of the rum.
2/16/2008,5,I didn't cook the eggs because I only use organic free-range eggs from a family I know. (You have a 1 in 30000 change of getting sick from eating regular raw eggs... the changes are even smal...
1/30/2008,5,Sooooo good! I made it exactly like you said and had no problems with curdling. It went down a treat on christmas eve - even in sunny Australia!!
1/23/2008,5,Great on a cold winter night when you are sitting around putting together puzzles and eating cookies!!  Better than store bought.
1/22/2008,5,I've made this recipe quite a few times and I've tampered with it...but seriously there's no need!  I LOVE it just as is.  Awesomely amazingly good eggnog!
1/21/2008,5,Creamy!!!  We loved it.  I make Eggnog every year even though its not a traditional Xmas drink here in Australia.  This was the best one I've tried so far and I'll be sticking with this recipe ...
1/15/2008,5,I hate eggnog but this was pretty good! I took it to a family Christmas dinner and everyone was raving about it. My MIL wouldn't let me bring the leftovers home! Hubby bought a carton from the ...
1/10/2008,5,This was my first time making eggnog and this recipe was perfect. Everyone enjoyed it and the rum can easily be added as needed. We used 2 cups instead of 2 and 1/2 but really you can be very fl...
1/9/2008,5,Excellent eggnog!  I left out the rum because I wanted to share with my children but I did add a touch of rum extract.
1/9/2008,5,This was my first attempt at home made egg nog and the results were fabulous!  Before I added the rum I set aside 1 quart of the mixture for a virgin eggnog as we were having lots of children f...
1/9/2008,5,I used this recipe over the holidays because my family loves eggnog. It has a smooth creamy texture and everyone loved it.
1/9/2008,5,Wonderful holiday treat!  I whipped up the egg yolks and sugar in my stand mixer and kept the mixer going as I added the milk.  Came out great.
1/8/2008,5,Very good nog! I went easy on the liquor but it was still too strong for my taste. My friends raved about how great is tasted. It was most people's first having homemade eggnog.
1/7/2008,5,Always good stuff.  I have found that a nice spiced rum works perfectly with the spices.  I use Captain Morgan but I am sure anything would work.
1/5/2008,5,This is Amazingly Good!  I added a bit more milk at the end when I added the rum.  I also whipped fresh whipped cream and sprinkled some nutmeg on top.  A definite party pleaser!
1/3/2008,5,This egg nogg did take a bit of time to make but in the end it was worth it. I loved the taste and everyone else in my family loved it too!! Looks like I found a holiday staple for my family. T...
1/2/2008,5,This was my first attempt at making eggnog.  It was easy and it really does taste amazingly good!  A new holiday tradition!
12/31/2007,5,Great recipe! We compared it side-by-side with the store bought kind and hands down this recipe is better! I only used 2 cups of rum and found it a bit strong still so next time I will start sma...
12/28/2007,5,I don't give many five star reviews but this deserves it. The BEST eggnog ever! I've made it with rum and rum extract (when we had non-drinkers over) and both were great. I also used this to mak...
12/28/2007,5,Delicious even with less rum. The flavors blend very well together; all our guests loved it.
12/27/2007,5,This was a hit at our house.  Thick and rich - I'd encourage people to try it with rum in it - added 'to your taste'.  It makes it more adult.  Could modify by adding more milk for thinner nog. ...
12/26/2007,5,Spicy and oh SO yummy!  Better than store bought. Don't change a thing.  Anyone who says it was not as thick as it should have been must not have cooked it enough.  I did it in a big metal bowl ...
12/26/2007,5,Awesome!  Wouldn't change a thing.  It was the best egg nog we've ever had.  I love that the eggs are cooked.
12/25/2007,5,Those years of experimentation really paid off. I'd never made homemade eggnog before because most recipes I found use raw eggs so when I found this one I thought I'd give it a try. It was wort...
12/24/2007,5,My husband won't buy the store stuff anymore he says he is ruined forever because this is so good.  We don't use rum or rum extract and still delicious.
12/24/2007,5,My Dad and I had an eggnog cook-off. It was both of our first times making eggnog. I used this recipe and Dad used Alton Brown's (food network). Mine won hands-down! I love this recipe and will ...
12/24/2007,5,This was great and SIMPLE!  Even those with little or no cooking skills could make this.  I only had 2 cups of white rum so topped it off with spiced rum and it was wonderful.  I have made the s...
12/24/2007,5,This recipe was definately amazing. I had to make two batches because it was loved so much.
12/24/2007,5,This was really good I only added 2 cups of the rum and found it very strong so added some more milk. Also made it without rum and and son loves it.
12/24/2007,5,This nog is da' bomb. I omitted the cloves for no better reason as I was feeling broke with the holidays and all. Those little things are pricey. I suppose I would have had more money if I had...
12/24/2007,5,Never made eggnog before in my life. I searched for the best (and easiest) cooked egg nog recipe with alcohol and this one was the winner! Super easy to make and delicious! I added 1 1/2 c. rum ...
12/24/2007,5,"This recipe is amazing. I didn't mess up the cooking so was brilliant. Was a little sweet so may use a third less sugar next time (I'm making it again tonight) but all in all was amazing.
I used..."
12/23/2007,5,I've got to say....I'm benefiting from your years in search of the perfect eggnog!  I made a batch tonight for sipping on Christmas Eve and it has the perfect amount of sugar seasoning and crea...
12/23/2007,5,Instead of rum as I distaste the substance I used a very pale ale. (Blue Moon if you must know.) and heavy cream for the light using the ale to thin as needed.  I didn't do the clove thing as...
12/23/2007,5,Fantastic recipe!  It was wonderful before and after adding the rum.  I will make sure to double the recipe next time.  I put in half the rum called for and think it would be too strong with wit...
12/23/2007,5,I just wanted to add a few comments since some of you have had trouble with the egg yolks cooking.  The milk should just barely  come to a boil not a full rolling boil.  Make sure you pour the ...
12/23/2007,5,Delicious! Very thick very smooth perfect taste. Everyone at work enjoyed it and was shocked to learn that it was home made.  Told by all that it's better tasting than the stuff bought in the ...
12/22/2007,5,great recipe!  1st time i've made eggnog.  i wanted to make sure i got it right and looked at a lot of different recipes tips and techniques.  alton brown from good eats suggest to first beat ...
12/22/2007,5,OUTSTANDING!  The first time I made it I made a half-batch (just in case) but that was totally unneccessary!  The first person who tried it actually asked how much I was selling it for - he th...
12/22/2007,5,This was the first recipe I tried from allrecipes and the first time I made my own eggnog and all I can say is WOW!  I made it exactly as written but reduced the rum by 1/2 a cup and it was perf...
12/20/2007,5,Thank you for this wonderful recipe! I followed the instructions precisely and it's fabulous! At my holiday party I set up a fully stocked bar in addition to the eggnog and only two people out o...

12/16/2007,5,Excellent! Cut the recipe in 1/2 to test it out.  Will be making the whole recipe for my cookie exchange party.  Thanks.
12/16/2007,5,OH MY GOD... absolute perfection! I used half-and-half because I couldn't find light cream in any store. I don't know how it was *supposed* to taste but I can't imagine it tasting any better th...
12/16/2007,5,This turned out really well.  I like the flavor and texture.  Next time i make it i will use vitamin D milk instead of skim milk.  I think that would help to make it a little thicker.  I will de...
12/15/2007,5,This recipe is really really good!!  Yummmmmmmm!!!  I like another reviewer slightly curdled my milk/egg yolk mixture while cooking (and I was sooo careful) but I too used my blender to smo...
12/13/2007,5,Holy Moly this will knock your socks off!!  I followed the recipe exactly and the end result was perfect.  Very creamy smooth and the rum is just enough to give it a kick!!  Awesome recipe.
12/13/2007,5,This made a wonderful eggnog! So thick and creamy! I used Splenda instead of sugar and i used 2 C of half and half and 2 C of cream to lighten it up slightly. It was quite heavy on the rum so I...
12/13/2007,5,This was delicious.  I used 10% cream instead of heavy cream and used a combination of cinnamon and cinnamon sticks.  A big hit and added all the rum although I was skeptical and it was perf...
12/13/2007,5,this was super easy and excellent! i got a ton of compliments on it - even from people who swore they disliked egg nog. i added an extra cup & 1/2 of rum so that it really packed a punch. delish...
12/11/2007,5,This recipe was absolutley AMAZING!  I had never attempted to make egg nog but was thinking of how great this would be to put in a basket of goodies for friends and family for Christmas.  I am ...
12/7/2007,5,This was probably one of the most ambitious recipes I've tried and the results are well worth the effort!  To temper the eggs pour about a half cup of the milk mixture into the eggs at a time a...
12/6/2007,5,I made my second batch yesterday and it turned out much better! I think using half and half cream really did it for me; my friends loved it. I left out the rum and put about a cup of sugar. It ...
12/5/2007,5,This is wonderful and I don't even like eggnog that much!  I think my sister in law would have drank the whole thing if we had let her!  We did serve the rum on the side for those  who wanted an...
12/3/2007,5,We loved this eggnog! It was well worth the work. We are big drinkers in my family and even we thought it was kind of strong. So next time I'll cut back on the rum:)Thanks for the great recipe ...
12/2/2007,5,This was the BEST egg nog I've ever had!!! It was soooo easy to make. I halved it for my test run and I wish I hadn't of! My bestfriend and I spent the day sampling the 'nog! I was expecting i...
12/2/2007,5,I've never been the domestic type; my first venture ever into the world of home-cooking was this year's Thanksgiving (crazy huh?).  But it turned out great with help from all the recipes on thi...
12/1/2007,5,This is in fact the best eggnog ever created.  I made it without the rum and it's absolutely perfect!  Even my husband who hates store bought eggnog really likes this.  Thanks for the recipe!
11/26/2007,5,Ohhohoh! So good! I did a half batch using whole milk (no cream) and omitting the rum (we have a four-year-old!). Because we used milk it was much thinner than it would be with cream but it wa...
11/25/2007,5,Not only did this make wonderful eggnog it made delicious ice cream too.  Just out of curiosity I put the leftover eggnog in my ice cream freezer and it turned out great.  I did leave out the ru...
11/24/2007,5,I made a double batch without the alcohol for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  I had no problems with texture or consistency. After cooling I added 4 cups of light cream and ten cups of milk...
11/22/2007,5,Super tasty and worth the effort!
11/20/2007,5,I've never made egg nog from scratch before nor had I ever had a homemade version so I couldn't say how this ranks in that category.  I CAN say that this was better than my favorite brand of s...
11/13/2007,5,this is the best egg nog i have ever had and it's easy! i was just getting excited today thinking about making it again soon. the stuff at the store can not even compare. this is so yummy esp...
11/12/2007,5,wow great recipe
11/6/2007,5,I only left out the rum.  I love this eggnog!!!  I don't think I let it thicken enough but still good for my first try.

9/25/2007,5,extremely good. dont add all the bottle of rum. got great reviews from xmas party
8/14/2007,5,So good.  I made this multiple times during the last holiday season.  People who say they don't like egg nog (probably have only had the store bought kind) love this egg nog.  And the fact that ...
3/23/2007,5,"Ill never by from a store again.
Option - cut the rum in one half - the flavor is still there but the alcohol effect is lessened."
2/16/2007,5,I made two batches of this over the holidays and we LOVED it.  The best was using it to make eggnog cappuccinos.  So good my favorite holiday addiction.
2/12/2007,5,This is head and shoulders above anything you could buy in a store!  I hate store-bought eggnog makes me gag.  But I loved this recipe!!
1/29/2007,5,I can't believe my first attempt at eggnog was this delicious! It was a hit at my Christmas party. It definitely needed the amount called for the rum...if not more. It's a definite keeper!
1/19/2007,5,This truly was wonderful.  I love the way the egg is cooked so you don't have to worry about Salmonella.  I actually cut the batch in half just before I added the rum so as my kids could enjoy i...
1/13/2007,5,This eggnog recipe turned out great.  I left out the alcohol so people could add the amount they prefer after pouring.  Thanks!
1/10/2007,5,My whole family loved it.  We didn't add the rum and I used half and half for the whole thing.  We'll definately make it next year!
1/6/2007,5,I didn't get the recipe to thicken much probably for fear of scrambling some eggs but even so it had great flavor. Thanks!
1/3/2007,5,This eggnog was wonderful.  Thick Creamy with awesome flavor.  I omitted the rum and it was very good.  I used a hand mixer instead of a wisk tho.  I also used a slotted spoon to take out the c...
1/3/2007,5,Made this for Boxing day and everyone loved it. I used less rum and let people top their drinks up if they wanted which a couple did. Next time I will use cinnamon sticks as I sieved this eggno...
1/2/2007,5,incredible! Really good. My son said he wished it had been thicker but I disagree.  I think he is just used to the artifical thickeners in the store bought stuff.  I may not have let it thicken...

12/30/2006,5,This was suberb. I made a hugh batch for Christmas and then split it making one batch non-alcoholic and the other batch with Captain Morgan's Spiced Rum. Many many compliments. Thanks.
12/30/2006,5,This is amazing. I've made this twice and I have to say when the recipe says DO NOT BOIL do not boil! The first batch didn't boil was cooked very slowly and came out delightfully. The secon...

12/28/2006,5,Wonderful egg nog and easy to make! Even family members who don't usually like eggnog enjoyed this recipe. Next time I will probably use a tad less rum but great overall!
12/28/2006,5,Made this for Christmas Eve and everyone LOVED it!!  My first crack at egg nog and I would make this one again.  The two things I did different is not cook the mixture until thick just hot and ...
12/27/2006,5,Awesome recipe!  I had no problems with curdling I think you need to go extra slow pouring the hot milk into the egg mixture.  I would also recommend dark rum - I only had 350mls and having tas...

12/24/2006,5,This was simple to make and turned out really great.  My father-in-law who loves eggnog drank half the recipe by himself.
12/24/2006,5,I quit drinking egg nog 25 years ago when I found out my Dad made my beloved beverage with RAW  eggs! I haven't had it since I was 10! This tastes exactly as I remember with the bonus of COOKED ...
12/23/2006,5,Oh Wow!  This is fantastic best eggnog recipe I have ever made.  It was time consuming but worth it. It took forever to get it to boil.  I finally turned it up just a bit.  It came out smooth....

12/22/2006,5,Excellent Nog! Store bought nog is too syrupy and sweet for my taste.  I decreased the sugar by 1/4 cup and only used 1 cup of rum.  The milk did not come to a boil in my doubleboiler so after 3...

12/19/2006,5,We loved this! I used Silk soy milk and soy half and half because my friend can't drink milk. I also used Captain Morgan's Spiced Rum instead of the light rum and only put in 1 1/2 cups but then...
12/17/2006,5,I couldn't imagine I'd get so many compliments! Many people (including myself) said they don't usually like egg nog but this is fantastic. I used 1% milk and substitued more milk for the rum s...
12/17/2006,5,Yikes @ the rum!!  And I'm a rum drinker and thought it was too strong!  Aside from that the recipe is good more involved than my mom's old recipe (which by the way DID use raw eggs and nobody ...
12/17/2006,5,I made two batches for a party alcoholic and non-alcoholic both were a hit!  It's nice to have a recipe that cooks the eggs.
12/16/2006,5,Excellent taste and a creamy consistency. I really like the fact that it's cooked too. I used spiced rum and fat free half and half. Fantastic.
12/16/2006,5,This recipe turned out amazing.  We drank some the first night we made it but in the morning after it sat is was even more amazing!  We did make some changes as suggested by others as follows fo...

12/7/2006,5,When doing this recipe pour the rum last and check to make sure it is up to your likes.  I made it with the original amount of rum and it came out super strong but it still a great recipe!
12/6/2006,5,Very tasty recipe & I'm an eggnog fan. My local store didn't carry light cream so I used 2 cups 1/2&1/2 with 2 cups heavy cream and that worked very well. Also used fresh ground ginger ( I use...

Delicious.  My first time making it and it turned out great!  This will forever be one of my christmas recipes."
12/23/2005,5,"Yep amazingly good stuff!!
I used half & half cream and a 1/4 less sugar. I seperated about 1/2 of it without the rum(for my nephew & me) and 1/2'd the rum. 
A keeper to be sure ;-)

12/11/2005,5,This was a great recipe. It wasn't as difficult as I thought it would be. After it sat overnight the nutmeg became very strong so I may cut down on that nextime. Other than that it was very good...
12/7/2005,5,I have never liked eggnog (I'd only ever had store bought).. I made this on saturday and it was absolutely WONDERFUL!!!  My 2 and 4 year olds loved it too (did I say I left out the rum??!! lol)....

12/15/2003,5,Sooooo delicious!  I kept going back for more . . and so did all the guests at the party.  Everyone was ranting and raving about this egg nog.  I plan on making this every year.
12/15/2003,5,This is the best egg nog I've every tasted!  If you don't rate this 5 stars then you don't know good egg nog!  Absolute must for your holiday celibration.

1/6/2003,5,In a word - excellent!  I will NEVER buy store bought egg nog again.
1/1/2003,5,This is fantastic egg nog! We served it new years eve and it was gone in the first hour.  I served rum and brandy on the side for our guests to spike themselves instead of mixing it in.

12/19/2002,5,This was extremely smooth and tasty.  Will definitely make it again!  I left out the rum since we don't drink but left everything else the same.

12/21/2016,4,Good recipe!  Be careful when pouring milk mixture into the egg mixture or else you will end up with sweet scrambled eggs. Pour slow and be sure to have a large enough pan.

5/2/2016,4,My family thought this was delicious! We didn't add any rum (just 1 tsp of rum extract) and we didn't have light cream so we used heavy cream and milk. Would have preferred it a little thicker (...

11/30/2014,4,I love this eggnog. I have cooked this too long before but went ahead and put it in glasses anyway. After it sat for awhile the solids separated from the liquid. So I ended up with a delicious c...
11/26/2014,4,I researched recipes and chose this one because I liked the cooking process she uses and her great ratings. I did tweak it myself. I omitted the cloves and used pumpkin pie spice instead of cinn...
11/17/2014,4,Very tasty - typically I like a little more booze in my egg nog but this recipe is solid.
12/31/2013,4,It was very good!
12/24/2013,4,gave this 4 stars but it was a close run for 5.  I read as many negative reviews as possible before reading to see what people were experiencing.  I truly believe if you use quality ingredients ...
12/17/2013,4,I really like this recipe. Since light rum was specified and I am not really sure what light rum is I went with Captain Morgan spice rum which is most delicious in this eggnog. I do use only...
12/13/2013,4,I made a small test batch to try as I have wasted alot of ingredients in the past on awful eggnog recipes. Nothing went to waste on this one as it was AWESOME!!!! I made it exactly as directed e...
11/20/2013,4,This recipe had great flavor and was pretty easy to follow but I love really thick eggnog and it lacked a little bit in that department. On average though one of the better recipes I've tried.
1/10/2013,4,This eggnog turned out excellent. I think using the full 2 1/2 cups of rum is a bit much it was too strong for my liking but was sure delicious nonetheless. Very easy to make too would defini...
1/1/2013,4,Nice creamy drink like a thin shake with a christmasy taste.
12/27/2012,4,I was a little disappointed with this recipe. The reviews made me very confident in the accurate eggnog taste this recipe would have. I just didn't like it a whole lot. It was a good drink but i...
12/13/2012,4,SO. Just finished making it- here's my twist. I used 2% milk and 10% cream. Instead of liquid vanilla I used 2 vanilla beans instead of ground cinnamon I used 2 cinnamon sticks and instead of n...
12/10/2012,4,Absolutely wonderful! I did cut back on the amount of rum and egg yolks. Instead of 12 I did 8 egg yolks and I used 2 cups of rum. That was enough for my taste. But I absolutely loved it. Everyb...
12/1/2012,4,I followed this recipe almost exactly.  The major change I made was the alcohol.  I used brandy instead of rum since it has a sweet smooth warm flavor.  I also cut the amount down by 1 cup -...
10/19/2012,4,This recipe was a little thinner than I typically like but the flavor was perfect.  (I used 2 tsp rum extract instead of rum.  We don't really drink much)
1/5/2012,4,Very tastybut never really got it to thicken correctly.  It didn't effect the taste though.  Will try again next year!
12/26/2011,4,"My first attempt at eggnog! I must have done something wrong though. There are small chunks in the end product.. I think I may have cooked the mixture too much.

However after sifting it its p..."
12/24/2011,4,I have always hated egg nog. I like this. I whipped the egg whites to peaks and added to the egg nog and used heavy cream because that is how my grandmother made it.  I did not add the rum and r...
12/24/2011,4,Was wonderful & everyone loved this eggnog.  Used half heavy cream & half 2% milk. Did have to cook longer than called for to make thick enough.  Will definitely make again!
12/10/2011,4,really good.  A little strong so next time a little less rum but the drunks at my party last night loved it.  ha!
12/10/2011,4,Delicious!  Not too difficult just make sure you temper your eggs before you mix them together.
11/9/2011,4,It was pretty complicated for somebody like me who doesn´t have so much experience but loves to try new things. It turned out nice but it didn´t blow me away and isn´t any better than a good b...
10/23/2011,4,This egg nog is very good.  I prefer more spices and less sugar. I also did not put any run.  But we all enjoyed it very much.  It is very important that the milk boil before you begin to add it...
8/23/2011,4,I made this last year and it was a hit.  Everyone has asked that I make it again this year.
8/16/2011,4,Very good.  Needs to be thicker though!
1/9/2011,4,Good but missing some flavor???
1/2/2011,4,Quite good but left out the rum. It was too sweet and it  left me feeling a little sick.
12/25/2010,4,Good recipe- easy to follow. Used almond milk and it seemed fine. Tasted great- liked that it wasn't super thick like some I've had. Biggest issue was the smell... very eggy. But other than that...
12/19/2010,4,Now this is real eggnog!  You won't find that artificial gross or syrupy tasting mess that is typical of store-bought eggnog here.  This eggnog is creamy decadent and natural.  In order to s...
12/15/2010,4,My grandmothers recipe is almost impossible to beat but it is old school and uses raw eggs (which as long as you wash the shell I’m ok with). I really like this -- only changes I will make is u...
12/15/2010,4,very good and not too strong!
12/12/2010,4,I will admit this is a very good recipe however I would advise using less rum. I'm sorry but it totally overpowers the taste of the eggnog. Although my husbands begs to differ.
1/2/2010,4,Made this yesterday with a few alterations.  My husband chose for us to use 1 cup Jack Daniels and 1 cup Bacardi light Rum.  I also whipped the egg whites till frothy and folded them into the fi...
12/31/2009,4,really good my problem was is strongly tasted like rum it wasn't super bad or had the burn when it went down. next time i'll cut back the rum
12/27/2009,4,Needs less rum but otherwise very good! I suggest leaving it up to the guest to top themselves off... then everyone wins!
12/24/2009,4,This is a very rich creamy egg nog. The recipe was easy to follow. I used fresh vanilla seeds rather than vanilla extract which worked fine and put in more nutmeg than the recipe called for t...
12/23/2009,4,Great taste but not thick at all. I left out the rum and let people add their own so I can't speak to whether o not 2 1/2 cups was too much or not. Also I kept the egg whites and beat them unt...
12/23/2009,4,Very good but too sweet for my taste. I also used half as much rum. I'll make this again with less sugar. Thanks for the recipe!
12/22/2009,4,did not add the alcohol.  this stuff is great!  very rich nothing like  store bought stuff.  i used heavy cream because i could not find light at my grocery store...turned out great although i w...
12/20/2009,4,I thought this was delicious and others did as well. It tasted like gingerbread. Mu husband thought it was too runny and cinnamon-y. It definitely took longer to prepare than 20 minutes... I did...
9/25/2009,4,I was generally satisfied with this recipe. I didn't have any cloves so I just left that out. I used only half of the alcohol and people still thought that was plenty. The only thing that bother...
2/4/2009,4,I didn't think I liked Eggnog until we made this for Christmas. Very good. Definitely let it sit overnight so all the flavors blend together. We also used less rum than was called for. We plan o...
12/22/2008,4,"If this recipe called for 1/2 the booze I would have ranked it a 5.  After reading several reviews I cut back the alcohol by 1/2 other than that I made this just like the recipe stated.

I tast..."
12/19/2008,4,it was good but its not common in our country so not everyone liked it.i used it as the milk for the pancakes the next morning and they were great pancakes!!
12/9/2008,4,I made this recipe last year and it turned out to tasted like real eggnog It didn't get creamy like eggnog.  It was pretty runny!
12/6/2008,4,I only used 1 cup of rum; 2.5 is WAY too much.  I also added the rum AFTER setting some aside for the kids and it still tastes great without the rum.  I only had dark rum on hand and it tastes f...
1/20/2008,4,Delicious! I converted non eggnog drinkers with this recipe...It's a bit of work to make but well worth it!
1/5/2008,4,Very yummy!  I had a slight problem with my eggs curdeling the milk so I took the suggestion of placing it in the blender and it worked like a charm.  Also we used 1 cup of Spiced Rum and it w...
1/4/2008,4,Very good flavor! It tasted like liquid ice cream with a kick....
1/2/2008,4,This was delicious!  I gave it a 4 because it seemed like a lot of work for a small amount of product.  I didn't add the rum so that kept the quantity low.  Everyone had about a half a cup and t...
12/31/2007,4,somehow i messed this up! i was tasting it throughout the prep but when i added the hot stuff to the cold mine didn't set right. but it was still good just runny. i will try again next year!
12/30/2007,4,I personally liked this but everyone else liked another recipe from this site much better.
12/27/2007,4,another recipe that i wanted to give 5 stars but it didn't quite rise to that level. i made a 1/2 batch (not enough eggs in the house on christmas day!) but it made a quart which is how i woul...
12/26/2007,4,This was my first attempt at making homemade eggnog and I and everyone who tried it agreed that it was WONDERFUL!!!! Thank you for the tasty and fairly easy recipe. It's a keeper!
12/25/2007,4,I gave this 4 stars because this eggnog was above average but not perfect. It wasn't really that difficult to make either. It was much thinner than I expected but I have grown up drinking the s...
12/25/2007,4,This was a great...it did not get as thick as I would have liked but that was probably my fault...I found that cutting it half and half with fresh brewed coffee is a wonderful idea and it tastes...
12/23/2007,4,I followed the recipe(that I halved) and it turned out great with such fresh flavor the only problem was it tasted a bit too rummy.. I solved this problem by serving it mixed with chocolate mil...
12/21/2007,4,very good I also added milk because of the thickness.. thank you very good!!  :)
12/21/2007,4,Like others before me I unintentionally cooked the egg mixture too long.  Our blender isn't working so I whipped the egg mixture with the whipping attachment on my food processor.  It worked wel...
12/19/2007,4,This was the first egggnog I have ever made so I don't really have anything to compare it to.  It tasted very good and was easy to make.  After I drank a glass of it I was so full I was unable t...
12/17/2007,4,This was a lot of work.  I haven't actually had eggnog for about two years because I live in South Africa.  I have to say that it does taste very good.  I didn't add any rum because I don't like...
12/3/2007,4,Left ou the rum so it was more sweet than most eggnog. I found a few drops of rum extract gave it a nice flavor though. I only had heavy whipping cream so I only added two cups of that and rep...
9/28/2007,4,I really enjoyed this and I don't even like eggnog.  Never will buy the carton again.
12/25/2006,4,This was good but NOT great in light of the effort and ingredients. It was a bit too rich for my tastebuds. My daughter who begs for eggnog during the holidays didn't like it. Of course she ...
12/22/2006,4,I thought the cinnamon was a tad too strong.  But otherwise good.
12/21/2006,4,Made twice.  First time was a little thick because I cooked it for about 20  minutes. When making again I was sure to not cook it longer than 15 minutes.  Took the advice and used half & half ra...
12/17/2006,4,Good but it doesn't taste anything like store bought. I'm not sure if that's a good thing. In all fairness I took the suggestion not to use the full 12 egg yolks and stopped at 10 and I found ...
12/8/2006,4,Our family prefers this recipe with spiced rum but it's a hit every year at our holiday party!
12/8/2006,4,"Hello everyone. Merry Christmas to you all.
I replaced the rum with Tia Maria...oooohhhhh   scrummy."
12/5/2006,4,Absolutely delicious!  I am still very much a novice in the kitchen but I managed to make this without any problems and it tastes fabulous. (We omitted the rum and used low-fat half and half in...
10/9/2006,4,Whoa nelly! I used a double boiler for heating the milk. Instead of whisking the milk mixture into the eggs and then back into the double boiler I just tempered the eggs with about 1/2 cup of t...
1/3/2006,4,I agree that the cinnamon was overpowering & will cut it in half next time. Other than this was a declicious eggnog. Very rich & creamy!
12/30/2005,4,This is pretty good but I like the Southern Comfort brand eggnog much better.
12/25/2005,4,Great recipe! I followed someone else's advice and reduced the amount of egg yolks. Being Indian I used masala chai spices consisting of cinnamon nutmeg cloves one peppercorn and cardamom(n...
12/23/2005,4,This is a very good eggnog recipe. A little too much cinnamon I would cut back on that a bit. Was a success at the family Christmas party.
12/28/2004,4,good but we didn't cook the egg yolk mixture in the sauce pan.  and we also beat the egg whites until stiff peaks formed and then stired that into the eggnog to make it thicker and creamery.
11/24/2004,4,GREAT recipe but add the rum slowly- I found that more than one cup of it was overpowering.
4/4/2003,4,Recipe is excellent espeically if you are making something with egg white and need something to do with the yolks.  Next time I would not use the rum at all and let anyone add it if they wish.  ...
10/25/2017,3,This was good ... not spectacular .  But My kids liked it . Next time I'll add less cinnamon . I whipped the eggs and sugar until light in color  didn't have one problem with the eggs curdling....
11/30/2016,3,I just left out the rum and found it tasted like cinnamon toast crunch did anyone else have that issue? I will probably half the cinnamon if not more. Will make again for sure
2/11/2016,3,It turned out a little too thick (my own fault while cooking). Rum taste is very strong.
12/30/2015,3,Only have it at 3 stars right now because I just made it. It was really easy to make didn't add the rum since kids will be drinking this also but it's going to be one of our New Year's Eve drin...
1/10/2014,3,I like my raw egg recipe better. I wanted to try this because I like the idea of making it in advance. Oddly to me it tasted a very much like store bought except not as sweet. My guests liked i...
1/6/2013,3,This tasted more like custard than egg nog but I still enjoyed it.
12/30/2012,3,Way too much cinnamon.  I had to strain it twice as much of the cinnamon formed clumps.  It tastes very much like the commercially available eggnog - nothing very special.  The recipe does make ...
12/31/2011,3,Too sweet if you don't use any alcohol (which recipe says is optional). Might be too much sugar with all that rum too haven't tried it. I strongly suggest starting with only 3/4c sugar; you can...
12/22/2011,3,This eggnog is only OK.  I have been making eggnog from the Joy of Cooking  cookbook for many years.  Of course this is better than store bought with all the store bought emulsifiers and prese...
12/20/2011,3,12 servings = 1500ml = nicely funneled into two 750ml wine bottles. Additionally the recipe tastes great but I had trouble getting the mixture to thicken at any stage. Almost all other eggnog r...
3/23/2011,3,I just didn't like this. A lot of time (and money) down the drain -- literally. Sadly I'd rather have store bought egg nog.
12/27/2010,3,too thick and sweet for me  maybe next time i use more milk then cream. also reduce the sugar and egg by one so it wasn't so thick.
12/23/2010,3,Ok DONT BELIEVE THE TITLE. I just made it according to the prescribed directions. I have found this too sweet and not impressed by its overall quality. The egggnog is not bad but it's not gre...
12/18/2010,3,I don't drink eggnog but my kids love it.  I'm giving this a 3 star mainly because they like store eggnog better but they're kids.  Didn't want to rate down for their opinion.  :-)
12/4/2010,3,I just made this recipe and my egg nog looks lumpy>>> I don't know what this means...
11/28/2010,3,Made this for the first time this Thanksgiving. Like the flavor but the vanilla is too overpowering almost like I'm drinking a vanilla milkshake (I left out the rum). Next time I will cut back...
12/23/2009,3,Don't think I made it right. It was chunky.
12/7/2009,3,This was nice and creamy but I expected it to have more flavor.  It was a very bland eggnog.  I think I will add less cream next time and bump up the spices.
12/24/2008,3,Im giving this 3 stars because I feel like it was good but it wasnt Amazing. I felt it had a good flavor but the consistency wasnt what I had expected. I like my eggnog thick. It does have a g...
12/20/2008,3,I made this for a party I was having and some people liked it and some didn't.  I had a lot left over at the end of the night. I didn't really like the flavor much; not very egg-nog-y.  I trie...
2/10/2008,3,tasted like a thick vanilla shake.. Maybe I did something wrong?
12/27/2007,3,I have to admit I was disappointed with this recipe given all the high ratings. It did not taste like eggnog to me more like a liquid version of rice pudding. It was good but just not like egg...
12/20/2006,3,Ouch.  I hate to be a spoilsport particularly with so many positive reviews and so close to Christmas but here it is:  I thought this recipe was just okay.  I decreased the rum by 1/2 because ...
12/12/2006,3,The flavor was good but the consistancy was too thin.  For those of us who are used to the creamy store-bought variety of eggnog I definitely recommend using heavy cream instead of light.  It's...
12/12/2006,3,I made it exactly as the recipe stated didn't change a thing and I thought it was the worst eggnog I've ever tasted sorry! I was so happy I found this recipe since I am in the UK from canada an...
12/19/2005,3,I thought this was a good drink but not good eggnog. It didn't really have much of that good old fashioned eggnog flavor.  Pretty decent holiday drink but more cinnamon or spice drink than egg...
12/14/2003,3,Well I know I'm going against the tide here but I just didn't think this recipe was that great.  I found it quite bland and blah acutally.  I tried adding more cinnamon & nutmeg but it was st...
1/6/2011,2,Not a favorite in our house...made it per the recipe.  If I try it again I will omit the cinnamon cut the vanilla by at least half and some of the clove.  Was just to spicy.  Liked the consi...
12/15/2010,2,Very nice - not like the store-bought eggnog I grew up on but very good. I took a batch to a work potluck and the older generation just raved about it. The younger ones could take it or leave i...
11/25/2010,2,I just made this eggnog recently and I was utterly disappointed. It had the perfect consistency but all I could taste was vanilla. It overpowers all of the other spices and it just doesn't taste...
12/30/2007,2,Way too much alcohol for my taste.  Didn't like the way it separated.
1/23/2006,2,This egg nog has a nice taste but because the eggs were cooked has a lumpy texture. I prefer the store bought egg nog...or perhaps this recipe without the cooking.
12/30/2003,2,This is one of three cooked eggnog recipes I found in AllRecipes but the only one I tried.  It truly is amazingly good and it's even better if left another day in the fridge for the flavors to...
12/28/2015,1,When I attempted to mix the eggs back into the other ingredients over the stove the eggs cooked and became solid even though the temperature was set appropriately.
11/30/2014,1,I did not care for this recipe.  I added half the sugar and it was still syrupy and way to over sweetened.
1/18/2013,1,I followed this to a T and it was awful.  It was too thin and for the amount of ingredients (not cheap by the way!) I should have just stuck with the Betty Cocker Cookbook version.
12/24/2011,1,I made this exactly as the recipe stated with timers and all and it still curdled.
12/18/2011,1,0 stars. This really smells bad.  I love egg nog and this is not something I can't even get past my tongue.  I should have known by the title amazing - the worst egg nog I have ever had.
12/17/2010,1,Amazingly good it is! I've used this recipe for the last 2 years! Since I live in Germany it'S hard to find eggnog. My family and I love it! I leave out the rum but thats all the ajustments I ma...
12/7/2010,1,I'm sorry but I can't give this 5 stars. The mixture was far to thick and didn't even taste like eggnog. Alton Brown has a recipe that I'll stick to......
10/13/2010,1,This is my first review  because normally the recipes turn out wonderful. But for some reason this egg nog did not smell... taste.. or even look like egg nog. My egg nog did not boil and it s...
12/18/2007,1,I did not care for this recipe.
12/27/2005,1,I am sooo so sorry but I nor my family that I had over for Christmas dinner liked this eggnog.  It was too strong in the liquor taste.  We couldn't drink it at all and believe me we are not a f...

1/9/2017,5,Awesome cheesecake and good instructions.  The first time I made it I just added a scant 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1 tsp cinnamon to the graham crust and made sure I pressed it down firmly.  That littl...

12/28/2016,5,"Hubby said it was one of  the best desserts he'd ever eaten.

12/26/2016,5,first cheesecake ever made and turned out wonderful.   it got rave reviews with all my guests
12/26/2016,5,This was delicious! I was worried that the eggnog flavor would be too mild to notice but this was not the case! I followed the recipe with just a couple of minor changes. I used a full of cup o...

Served the cheesecake with candy cane ice cream!"
12/25/2016,5,I made this for Christmas dinner and everyone loved it.  I don't even like cheesecake but I thought it was really good.  My nutmeg was stale so I also added ground cloves.  Not sure if it made a...
12/25/2016,5,Tasted great. Cooked in 425 for ten minutes and then turned oven down to 250 just as recipe said to do. I also put a pan of water below on the lower rack after reading other reviews. After the s...

12/7/2014,4,The filling is very good. You don't need to precook crust. Change the crust to 1 1/2  cups cracker 1/3 cup butter. Sugar ok. Use mixer not food processor for filling.

12/27/2010,3,Baking time or temperature must be way off on this cheesecake because it took another hour in my oven before it looked like it was finished. Even then when we cut into it it was so soft it all ...
12/27/2010,3,I made this with a gingersnap crust instead.  I should have cooked it longer...it was not cooked enough in the middle.  I topped with with whipped cream and cinnamon.  It seemed to need a little...
12/13/2010,3,I was really excited to try and make this and read all the reviews/suggestions before I made it.  Next time I will bake it a little longer and I won’t use rum extract but vanilla extract and c...
3/20/2010,3,Didn't cook enough- need to increase cook time but I think it depends on your oven. We like the pumpkin cheesecake recipes much more
1/24/2010,3,I liked this but it wasn't anything to write home about.  I would rather just have some eggnog and some regular cheesecake.  No need to combine them.
1/1/2009,3,This was just so so for me and my husband. The flavor didn't wow us and we both love eggnog. I used cinnamon graham crackers added nutmeg to the crust and added a bit more eggnog then called fo...
12/25/2008,3,ok..wont make again.  Taste and texture was ok...it might have to do with eggnog ...just not a big fan so why was i making it anyway?  I did enjoy that the crust actually adhered to the cake an...
1/28/2007,3,Great cheesecake but you can barely taste the eggnog so in the end it tastes like a regular cheesecake with a hint of cinnamon. The friends I made this for love eggnog so it was a little disa...
11/24/2006,3,i have made this twice. the eggnog flavor and the cheesecake texture are fabulous - but it wasn't sweet enough for me either time.
12/27/2016,2,I liked the flavor of the cheesecake but I must have done something wrong.  The cheesecake never baked completely in the center.  When I sliced it it looked like melting ice cream..... So very ...
11/20/2009,2,After reading all of the reviews I was excited to make this.  The only change I made was to double the graham cracker crust as suggested by a review.  I baked it in a water bath let it cool in ...
12/20/2006,2,Eggnog flavor was masked not very sweet and required extra baking time with the oven set at 250.  Next time I will stick with my standard cheesecake recipe.
12/25/2014,1,I make cheesecakes a lot. The 250 degrees isn't high enough to cook through. This needs to be at least  325 degrees and for an hour. What a disappointment very soggy  and unedible for my Christm...
12/28/2011,1,great recipe.  Too bad the cooking instructions ruined it.  NO cheesecake will ever set if cooked as directed.  Bake it at 325 for at least 1.25 hrs.
12/25/2008,1,Cheesecake had the consistency of a no-bake cheesecake. I have baked many cheesecakes before and have never had any turn out with the texture this one had. Baked exactly according to directions....
12/24/2008,1,I have no idea what happened with this recipe but my cheesecake came out NOTHING like it was supposed to.  The center of the cake did not cook at all and I had it in their for an extra 40 minute...
1/14/2017,5,loved it but didn't make any changes
12/26/2016,5,Never had a chance to make these. Hope for New Years.
12/15/2016,5,These cookies were a big hit with my family! Because they were simple and delicious to make that made them a big hit with me!
12/12/2016,5,My favorite for three years running. They can be fairly rich depending on how much frosting you put on. Add spices to the dough and use a piping bag so they're pretty.
8/29/2016,5,Awesome
12/23/2015,5,These cookies were a hit with my family! I followed the recipe exactly as written although I did add a dash of nutmeg to the cookie dough for more flavor. I used Irish butter for the frosting an...

12/18/2015,5,These are my favorite cookies!  I have made them several times now following the recipe exactly.  The cookies are plain but the frosting is very sweet and has a great flavor.  I usually top th...
11/26/2015,5,Followed recipe. Turned out great
1/9/2015,5,New family favorite. Super easy and fun because you can change up the decor to fit the occasion so you have an excuse anytime of the year to whip up a batch. They came out perfect the first ti...
12/20/2014,5,This was an amazing cookie.  I know that I will make this recipe over and over again.  Even my daughter who usually doesn't like confectioners' sugar frosting absolutely loved it.  So good!  N...
12/15/2014,5,Great recipe! This is definitely one for the Christmas cookie list to make every year. My husband loved them. Cook time of 11 minutes is perfect and added a full tsp of vanilla.
12/14/2014,5,Awesome recipe.  Delicious cookies!  The rum in the icing was awesome. I doubled the recipe and made the half I was taking to church with maple in them and the half that was for us with rum.  Bo...
12/29/2013,5,I thought this was a very nice looking and tasting cookie. I have added it to my Chirstmas collection.  I got 50 cookies. I would double the frosting and then pipe it in the thumbprint. Other th...
12/21/2013,5,Rave reviews from all who tasted these gems. I used super fine baker's sugar for the dough and they were delicate and yummy. I will be making these every holiday season!
12/19/2013,5,"My family loved these ! They don't taste exactly like eggnog but they do have that spicy flavor. I only made a couple adjustments. As others suggested I used real rum and 
substituted it for the..."
12/13/2013,5,These were very easy to make.  I added more nutmeg and they really  tasted just like eggnog.
12/8/2013,5,These are wonderful with great flavor and just the right level of sweetness.
3/27/2013,5,Yummy! Added eggnog extract to both the cookie and the filling.
3/26/2013,5,Big hit at our house! I doubt these will last 1 day the way my boys are gobbling them up! Btw this recipe only made 29 cookies for me but I don't think I could've made them much smaller.
1/22/2013,5,This is a really different flavored cookie but the kind that it was hard to eat just one.  The nutmeg sprinkled on the top really helped it all go together.  Easy to make.  I didn't have anythi...
1/5/2013,5,Very good! I did not have nutmeg so I did without. I did however add the rum and it was very tasty. Another way I changed was to sub out some of the butter and used applesauce made for a moiste...
12/12/2012,5,This is a great recipe as is. :) Buuuuut ;) if you are a big eggnog fan I have one suggestion make the frosting with eggnog liqueur. Yum! Both are great. Love this recipe will definitely make ...
12/12/2012,5,These really do taste like egg nog.  Easy to make and I followed the recipe exactly.  I used a decorator tube to apply the topping to the completely cooled cookies.  The topping really does mak...
12/3/2012,5,This is the second year I have made these for my Christmas trays and we love them. The food editor at the Las Vegas Journal requested a special Christmas cookie to feature and this one immediate...
12/3/2012,5,I LOVE this recipe.  I have never had a recipe that is so universally loved and one that I am constantly asked to share. I do find the dough the most temperamental- Don't melt the butter just s...
8/20/2012,5,Best cookies ever. Made as written with 151 Bacardi Rum. Amazing. I had no problem with the frosting being runny. If anything it was too thick and I live in a humid place.
7/28/2012,5,I have made these several times now. It is my families most requested cookie no matter what time of year it is. They are simple to make and taste incredible. I don't find the cookies bland as ot...
1/6/2012,5,These will be the traditional Christmas cookie for many many many holidays to come :] I would have never guessed that a hint of rum added to some butter and confectioners' sugar could be so de...
1/4/2012,5,OMG I had to make these twice in 2 days because they were such a hit. I used overproof Jamaican rum (blame the padres for that one) I dunno if I made them too big but the batches only made abou...
12/26/2011,5,super easy and super delish! the only mistake I made was putting the frosting on too soon on the 1st batch! After I realized my mistake I quickly refrigerated them and they were fine! Will make ...
12/21/2011,5,I must have made mine too big as I only got 2 dozen out of this batch. I uses my Pampered Chef scoop which is not as messy as rolling them by hand and it guarantees the same size cookie every ti...
12/21/2011,5,I LOVE these cookies! They're delicious and cute :) they went really nice with the other cookies to add variety for my holiday mix. I only made one small change (as many others had) I used 1tsp ...
12/19/2011,5,The perfect Christmas Cookie!
12/7/2011,5,These cookies are DELICIOUS and easy to make! I made only a 1/2 batch to try them out and will definitely be adding this to my Christmas baking list. The cookie all by itself is a great texture...
12/2/2011,5,Wow!  I just tried one of these and they are amazing!  I used a full teaspoon of vanilla but followed as directed otherwise. Used the end of a wooden spoon to make indentation and baked on parch...
12/2/2010,5,I'm really interested in making these but wonder what type of rum everyone used?  Spiced or light?
11/22/2010,5,Good cookie!  Not a visual stand-out but it'll be great served with a variety of other cookies.  I wanted something that wasn't chocolate and these worked out great.  You could easily drop a fe...
12/23/2009,5,This is my new favorite holiday cookie. I admit I am an eggnog fanatic including eggnog lattes. I made these as per the recipe. They are easy and delicious. As for the color not so much. I may...
12/15/2009,5,Absolutely amazing cookies!
12/9/2009,5,This cookie was DELICIOUS - we made it for our annual cookie bake this year and this is definitely going to become a staple.  EVERYONE in our family loved these cookies.  We used a pastry bag f...
12/6/2009,5,awesome awesome awesome. My family couldn't get enough of these. I used a pastry bag with a large plain tip. It made the frosting application super slick.
1/2/2009,5,My boyfriend went crazy over these! I made a batch to bring to work and there were still a bunch left over... he hoarded the rest and refused to let them out of his sight until he ate them all!...
12/21/2008,5,I have been searching for the perfect egg nog cookie recipe for 6 years... and I this is by far my favorite.  I have made 2 batches.  The dough comes out beautifully.  I think next time I make i...
12/6/2008,5,Really good.  They have a nice soft texture the cookie itself doesn't have much flavor so the frosting is key.  They spread more than i expected next time i'll chill the dough before baking a...
12/6/2008,5,These cookies were easy to make.  They tasted and looked as good as the picture.  My family and friends finished the batch in 1 day.  I have learned that I need to make multiple batches at a tim...
1/27/2008,5,Tasted great but kind of fell apart on me.
1/7/2008,5,Some of the best sugar cookies I've ever made.  I have had many requests for this recipe.  They turn out perfect every time!
12/7/2007,5,The frosting makes the cookie on this one. Be sure to follow the recipe and let the cookies cool completely before frosting or your buttery frosting will melt!  Oh and PS I only got 30 cookies...
12/4/2007,5,These cookies are really good.  I doubled the recipe and as a reviewer suggested added rum extract and nutmeg to the batter. I did use Captain Morgan Spiced Rum (2 1/2 tablespoons) in the frosti...
12/3/2007,5,These are soooo good! It really does taste like a rum and eggnog!
6/11/2007,5,These cookies turned out perfect!! I used 1/4 t of rum extract instead of rum and they just taste wonderful.  I had to bake them for longer then 12 min but I probably made them huge because I...
12/18/2006,5,these are amazing...i made these for my christmas cookie exchange these would also be good with jam in the middle i will keep this recipe forever
12/27/2005,5,These were great  picture perfect!! Wonderful addition to my holiday cookie tray!!!

12/15/2005,5,Wonderfully different recipe for the holidays!  Certainly a keeper for us.  I was afraid I wouldn't have enough filling...but it was PERFECT!
12/10/2005,5,i stumbled upon this recipe four years ago and they have become an annual favorite at christmas time!
12/10/2005,5,This recipe was great! Everyone at work liked them and asked for the recipe.  The only thing I did different was I only had coconut rum. And that's what I used.  They were excellent.
12/3/2005,5,I have been making these cookies since 2000 and every year they are my biggest request.  My family literally beg me to make them.  The cookies are simple but combined with the flavorful frost...
11/24/2005,5,These are delicious and easy to make! They've been a favorite in my house since I first made them about 3 years ago.
11/23/2005,5,I have been making these since I found the recipe here about 3 years ago.  My co-workers and friends have reaped the benefits of enjoying these cookies.  They are so yummy.  I use real rum of co...
9/19/2005,5,These were great and to bring out the eggnog flavor even more I added 1/2 tsp rum extract and 1/4 tsp nutmeg right into the batter.  I melted the butter for the icing but made it a little to ...
12/26/2004,5,"I have made this two years in a row and I always receive rave reviews.  I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/4 cup of shortening.  I also used rum flavoring instead of the vanilla.  Great taste.
Thanks..."
12/24/2004,5,this was very yummy!!!
2/20/2004,5,I probably shouldn't write a review on these cookies cause I changed the recipe.  But they were delicious.  I didn't have any rum so I used coconut flavouring in the cookie base and added vanill...
1/3/2004,5,This was my 2nd year baking these Cookies for Christmas. I loved them last year and again this year and they are popular with my recipients. The best unique part is the FILLING (after all it f...

12/20/2003,5,WOW!  I almost didn't try this recipe after reading some of the unfavorable reviews but I am SO glad I tried it.  A couple of things that maybe would have tripped me up might be helpful to othe...
12/20/2003,5,I found this recipe in the Allrecipes cookbook and used it for a cookie exchange.  It was easy to do with few ingredients and made quite a few dozen at a time.  Everyone loved the taste and my ...
12/19/2003,5,I took this to a Christmas Cookie Exchange and EVERYBODY asked for the recipe.  I used the rum extract and the milk and they came out great!  Thanks for the recipe.  I will make these again and ...
10/24/2003,5,Taste like old-fashioned bakery holiday cookies. I used Godiva liquer instead of rum and they were even better.
2/2/2003,5,A surprise favorite in my office for Christmas!
12/30/2002,5,I am a huge Eggnog fan and had tried another recipe just before that which used Eggnog.  It didn't taste anything like Eggnog at all unlike this recipe which I have since shared with many people...
12/16/2002,5,I made some of these to bring to a Christmas party and to work.  People at both ends raved about them!  They really do taste like eggnog and the filling (more like frosting really) has a great...
12/5/2002,5,I made these last year and they were such a big hit that I will be making a lot more this year. They taste great. Making them is fun with the rum and friends!
11/18/2002,5,This cookie is a winner!  Go all the way use the rum and spread cheer to any lucky person who selects this cookie from your cookie tray.  This is a HUGE hit at our Christmas party!
1/15/2002,5,Very easy to make!
12/28/2001,5,This is an excellent cookie.  It was this year's favorite among everyone.  The filling really does taste like eggnog with the rum and the nutmeg.  Noone thought the rum was overpowering. The coo...
12/23/2001,5,Very good cookie!!  It's true - it's not very colorful but the taste was wonderful!  If you're having trouble spooning the filling into the cookie use a decorating tube or a plastic sandwich ...
12/19/2001,5,Simple and yummy!  I made these for a cookie exchange and they were a hit with both friends and family.  Even the kids can help (with the thumb print part).  I've found a new Christmas cookie tr...
12/17/2001,5,Easy delicious cookies.  Pretty presentation and most importantly very sweet... satisfies even the sweetest sweet tooth.  We loved them.
12/17/2001,5,Great cookie!  I made them to have for Christmas but we've eaten them all so I have to make more.  Very easy recipe and the rum gives it a great flavor but then I love rum!  I think this will...
12/17/2001,5,I participated in a cookie exchange this past weekend and these were the hit of the party!  They did turn some people off because of the name and people said that they didn't like eggnog much...
12/15/2001,5,Not the prettiest cookie on the cookie tray but one of the best tasting!
12/12/2001,5,"Excellent recipe -- i loved these cookies and i don't even like eggnog that much.  I made them for a holiday bake sale at work -- and they were a hit.

Thank you!"
12/10/2001,5,These cookies are AMAZING!! They're really easy and they really do taste like eggnog. At first the rum flavor will be strong (you can always use rum flavoring for the non-alcoholic types) but g...
12/9/2001,5,I took these to work and people swarmed me!  I will definitely make these again!
1/23/2001,5,These tasted great and were a big hit at Christmas time. Wonderful recipe to have the grandkids help with the thumbprint.
12/31/2000,5,This recipe is excellent!! I made them at Christmas time this year and while they were warm the kids liked them and after they cooled my husband and I really enjoyed them!! Thank you and have a ...
12/26/2000,5,Goodbye waistline!  These cookies are addictive!  I absolutely love them as does everyone else!  They will definitely be a holiday tradition from now on!  Thanks for the recipe! :)
12/19/2000,5,I made these for the first time last night.  They are delicious.  My family loved them and my mother-in-law immediately asked me for a copy of the recipe.
12/12/2000,5,I made these for a cookie exchange and everyone wanted the recipe!  The only danger is that you will want to eat them all (and they are small so you feel like you can! :))
12/6/2000,5,This recipe is GREAT! They are easy and very very good. I made these cookies for the first time last year and my whole family requested them again.
12/4/2000,5,I've made this cookie for three Christmases now and it's become my favorite.  Extremely tasty highly addictive and very easy to make!  Also it can easily be doubled.
11/29/2000,5,This recipe is loved around my house at Christmas time.  I altered it by adding more rum to the frosting.  They are best after a day or two because the alcohol from the extra rum evaporates ju...
11/27/2000,5,"This is one of the best Christmas cookies I've ever made and trust me I've made MANY. Here are my recommendations.
-DO use the rum extract; it's the key to making this an *eggnog* cookie. With..."
12/21/2014,4,They are good but I don't get the eggnog thing. My son and I had fun making them. Will keep this recipe.
12/21/2014,4,"My family and I really liked the idea of an Eggnog cookie so it was impossible to not try this recipe. In the end we were all very pleased with how it turned out.
The cookie itself wasn't bad..."
12/10/2013,4,WOW! What a great cookie!!! I've been wanting to make these for a long time but some of the negative reviews have scared me away. A former co-worker of mine bakes hundreds of holiday cookies ev...
12/28/2011,4,I really enjoyed these cookies. The cookie itself was very tender and crumbly which I enjoyed. Make sure to mix in the flour by hand. The dough should be rather dry and crumbly. If you have one...
12/17/2011,4,God flavor but I must have done something wrong.   Mine came out flat not with a dent in the middle.  Even tried chilling the dough.  More flour?  Use shortening instead of butter?
4/12/2011,4,I colored the filling with yellow food coloring and sprinkled with white snowflake sprinkles.  I also added extra rum extract for some added kick.  A great addition to my Holiday cookies. I will...
1/11/2011,4,Good recipe would be even better with nutmeg in the batter.
1/8/2011,4,These were great and everyone raved about them.  I piped the frosting into the thumbprints to make a pretty presentation on the plates we gave away for Christmas.
12/30/2010,4,Turned out good.  Used rum extract.
12/14/2010,4,Not very attractive. It seems like the dough balls should be rolled in nuts? The frosting and nutmeg make them delicious though.
9/22/2010,4,Don't make my mistake - I used margarine instead of butter.  It was a disaster - the icing doesn't set!
1/25/2010,4,Pretty good.  Used them as one of my Christmas cookies.  They weren't my favorite so I'll probably just try something else next year.  Can also use a different filling like melted chocolate in t...
1/11/2009,4,This recipe came out fairly delicious but I feel like it could be improved... the cookies were too sweet and rose too much for the thumbprint to allow these cookies to be filled (i basically fr...
12/10/2008,4,I'm glad I finally made these. I had trouble with my cookies spreading so I made them into 1tsp bites instead. I added nutmeg to the dough and a little extra to the icing. To keep the icing f...
12/9/2008,4,Very very good the cookie was very crunchy but the frosting was good.  I hope they freeze well
1/5/2008,4,I made a couple of alterations to this recipe. I added about 3/4 t. nutmeg to the dough which made a nice buttery cookie with an eggnog kick. I didn't care for the icing but I also didn't have r...
12/31/2007,4,This was a good cookie recipe. Making it though I did make some changes I felt the cookie needed. Since the dough did not have any eggnog ingredients and just the frosting I added nutmeg to the...
12/12/2007,4,My dough seemed soft and the cookies didn't hold the thumbprint very well.  I used 2 tsp. of rum extract and a little cream for the icing since I didn't have any rum and I used a pastry bag wit...
12/21/2006,4,I'm not big on frosting myself but these were a hit with everyone else.
12/6/2006,4,I altered this recipe but would stil recommend it. The cookie is a good base but I prefer something softer so next time I will use a different thumbprint base. What made the cookie was the fros...
7/27/2006,4,Really good and really simple to make!  The topping is a little strong though.  I used real rum.
1/13/2006,4,These were very good cookies. I will probably make them again next christmas.
12/30/2005,4,These were very tasty!
12/13/2005,4,I thought they were just ok....then I served them! People asking for more and more and more. Has a nice kick to them too!
11/24/2005,4,These were remarkably easy to make and taste awesome. I didn't have any nutmeg so I sprinkled them with cinnamon. I also added a little bit of vanilla soymilk and a second tablespoon of rum to...
12/28/2004,4,Wow! If you like eggnog you probably will enjoy these. I used 1/4 cup butter and 1 stick of ICBIB margarine. I also used 1/4 tsp of rum extract and milk instead of rum for the frosting.  I also...
12/5/2004,4,Delicious! Instead of the icing drizzle recipe offered I mixed egg nogg with powdered sugar and drizzled over the cookies. Delicious!
1/4/2003,4,I took these cookies to a Christmas cookie exchange and they were a big hit.  Several people wanted the whole batch.
12/27/2002,4,Recipe did not double well turned out very dry.  Good cookies and the icing is delicious.  Not a huge egg nog flavor though.  Also icied it with a powdered sugar eggnog icing.
2/10/2002,4,Rich but very good!
12/31/2001,4,These cookies were a big hit with my family!  They had wished I'd made more.  I found this to be a very easy recipe and had no problems whatsoever.  My 3 year old daughter loved making the thumb...
12/18/2001,4,These cookies are delightful!  They are a cinch to make and the taste awesome!
12/18/2001,4,I made these for the first time and I am getting rave reviews! I wouldn't add any more rum than it calls for though I added a little more and my co-workers LOVE it but say you can deifinatly t...
1/6/2014,3,So far these are really average cookies. I'm not a huge fan of icing so that's probably why I'm not crazy about them. They are kind of weird in that it is really difficult to tell when they are ...
1/15/2013,3,Good cookie but we didn't detect the eggnog flavor. Would like to try again to figure out why but would still make a good jelly thumbprint.  Watch baking time or they'll be too crunchy.
3/10/2011,3,Didn't care for these.  They were just okay.  I noticed they were the last cookie on the tray as well.  Perhaps just me since others really liked them.
12/25/2010,3,I am sort of on the fence about these cookies. Like some others my main problem is with the cookie base. They turn out too dense--not tender enough for my liking. I think I would look for anoth...
12/21/2009,3,The frosting on these was delicious but I had the same problems some others did: the cookies were very hard.  Not pleasantly crispy -- hard.  I left them in for 12 minutes and they certainly l...
6/24/2009,3,The cookie itself is good but the filling doesn't taste like eggnog at all. If I ever make them again I'll definitely try using a different type of rum.
12/22/2008,3,"I am a huge egg nog fan and i just didnt taste the egg nog in these cookies. 
mine didn't turn out puffy like the pictures that have been put up-even though i followed the directions exactly. se..."
12/25/2007,3,The flavor of these were interesting.  My mom didn't think the flavor was strong--that being said if you don't like eggnog steer clear of these.  My dough didn't come out very smooth nor did ...
11/14/2006,3,These didn't really taste much like eggnog to me more almond-y than anything else.
12/10/2005,3,Kinda a bland little cookie with super-sweet frosting.  As with other reviewers I used milk and rum extract to flavor the icing and wonder if real rum would have made a difference.  Also if I ...
11/7/2004,3,I'm not as impressed with these cookies as other people seem to be.  The cookies themselves have a nice texture but don't overcook them!  They get very dry if you let them get even the slightes...
12/17/2003,3,Everyone that I had try one said they were okay but didn't taste like eggnog at all. I read so many reviews that said they did so I am wondering if maybe you need to use Rum to get that taste. I...
12/7/2003,3,Bake for only 12 minutes even though they don't look cooked.  I let them bake longer because they still lokked soft and when they cooled they were hard as rocks.  Also I think the dough could be...
1/7/2003,3,These cookies were okay. The filling was tasty and added a nice flavor but the actual cookies were a bit dry and flavorless. It might have tasted better if they cookie dough has some nutmeg an...
12/3/2002,3,Alot of work for these cookies. Not sure how often I am giong to be making these.
12/18/2001,3,My husband and I love eggnog but neither of us were impressed with these cookies. The cookie part was a little too dense and firm for my taste probably because of the lack of baking soda or po...
12/16/2015,2,"I did make changes and I am on the fence about these cookies as another 3 star commenter said.  Pretty much  my comments are like Joy Bugaloo's.

Also the pics are not realistic.  What are t..."
12/14/2014,2,Good cookie but I can't taste the eggnog at all and since that's what I was going for I'm disappointed.
2/18/2014,2,Made just as recipe is given. Frosting has nice rum flavor very smooth. Nutmeg gives it the perfect spice punch. Cookie is beyond  sweet.  Like beyond. Thank you for the recipe it was easy to...
1/3/2013,2,I was very disappointed in these.  Not much flavor even though I added a bit more rum than called for.
12/27/2011,2,I'm not sure why my cookies came out too sweet and too hard and I don't think they taste much like egg nog.  The only difference I made in the recipe is that I didn't have nutmeg so I substitut...
1/17/2006,2,These did not work for me. The eggnog mix was to strong and my cookies flatened out:(
5/28/2003,2,I am a pretty experienced cook and housewife so I am pretty sure I got the recipe right but these are FAR FAR too rich for us. The frosting tastes like eggnog flavored butter. A total of 3 got e...
12/26/2001,2,I was so excited to make these after all of the good reviews you had listed.  I will not make these again the cookie was dry too sweet and they looked so plain.  The cookie dough did not roll...
12/18/2001,2,I don't know about these cookies.  We made them and no one who tasted them liked them.  They definetly don't taste like eggnog.  The frosting is very odd too it's very runny.  When I think abou...
12/21/2014,1,Followed this recipe as written. This looked and tasted NOTHING like the pictures or other reviews. I always make christmas cookies and the cookies came out flat and tasted like butter. When I a...
11/26/2017,5,I made this a year and a half ago and it turned out perfectly. Even those who didn’t like hollandaise sauce loved this recipe. I’m rating it now because I tried a different recipe on this site ...
11/18/2017,5,This was so yummy and so easy!! No separation what so ever! My son and I had been looking for an easy one but they all separated until now. Now I can make eggs Benedict in no time! Can’t wait t...
10/2/2017,5,I've tried a couple of blender recipes before and this is by far the best in terms of both flavor and texture. I melt the butter on the stovetop and pour it in *very slowly* while still bubblin...
9/29/2017,5,This recipe was so simple and amazing. I didn't have Tabasco and it didn't even need it. So amazing! Add a little salt and pepper at the end. Best thing to make on Mother's Day
8/14/2017,5,Loved this!  So tasty and delicious!  So simple too.  Mine was a bit thick probably due to the large yolks from the large eggs I had.  I wasn't sure of the best way to thin it so I didn't do any...
7/30/2017,5,This is my go-to recipe for Hollandaise be it just for myself or a party of 12.  I prefer the tartness in this and it's the perfect consistency every time.  I don't worry about over cooking it...
7/28/2017,5,the sauce tastes great.  I totally recommend trying this.
7/7/2017,5,Excellent results.  I have made this several times now and always get rave reviews.  So glad I found this recipe.
6/18/2017,5,Made no changes will definitely make again.  Super easy and good!
5/22/2017,5,This is very good Hollandais sauce. Very easy and great texture and loved the buttery taste. I agree with another review that it lacks a little flavour. I did skip the hot sauce and add some Cay...
5/18/2017,5,This is really good but I had to heat the butter on the stove to ensure it was hot enough to thicken in the blender.
4/30/2017,5,Soooo easy and sooooo good!!   I just added a little fresh targon to give it a little extra yumminess.
4/23/2017,5,Easy to make and very testy
4/20/2017,5,I have made this sauce dozens of times slaving over a double boiler but I needed a faster easier way to make it for a brunch of 14 people. I found another way on the stove top on YouTube and wh...
4/17/2017,5,We have eggs Benedict every Easter and make them for a crowd. For years I used the Hollandaise double boiler recipe from The Joy of Cooking. This year we tried blender Hollandaise which has th...

4/16/2017,5,Added a dash of salt to cut the lemon but otherwise super easy fast and good recipe!
3/25/2017,5,Quick easy and awesome. I have used this recipe for at least a year I eliminate the Dijon for eggs benedict but include it for other uses. I love how easy this is not only to make but clean u...
3/24/2017,5,I've used packaged dry mix to make hollandaise in the past. To me this recipe was about as easy as that! And so much tastier! No weird processed flavor just egg-y buttery goodness. Careful whe...
3/18/2017,5,Yum! I've always been intimidated by Hollandaise sauce and this worked out GREAT! Granted I (nor the hubby) has ever actually had the sauce in a restaurant so we don't know what it's supposed...
3/16/2017,5,Deceptively easy! Simple and fool-proof.
2/25/2017,5,Worked a treat. Used course grain  mustard and blitzed it a bit longer. Didn't use hot sauce as I have a fussy family. After making the sauce I used a ban marie to keep it warm which thickened ...
1/25/2017,5,I had never tried making Eggs Benedict before but decided to give it a try. This sauce is absolutely amazing unchanged and extremely easy. I will be saving this recipe forever!
1/10/2017,5,I have made (or tried to make) Hollandaise sauce many times but it always tastes terrible. I just tried this recipe 'as is'.  It was simple and it tastes really good. I will definitely make it ...
1/9/2017,5,My husband (who used to be a cook) and I had a little competition this morning to see which hollandaise sauce would be better because when I read this recipe to him he thought it was crazy to a...
1/6/2017,5,Will never make hollandaise outside of a blender again!
12/30/2016,5,Very simple to prepare.  I let it sit for a bit longer than expected while my eggs were poaching and the sauce thickened up.  A quick run through the blender again brought it right back to the ...
11/6/2016,5,"I think it's a great alternative to making it the conventional way. Personally think the mustard and tabasco were a perfect touch.

The most useful recommendation I have since the poached eggs ..."
10/28/2016,5,I like this sauce a lot! I actually followed the directions exactly and I like how it tastes. You can't really point out the hot sauce or mustard. I switched the serving  size to 4 to make for 4...
10/23/2016,5,this was good as written definitely needs dijon or another splash of hot sauce otherwise kind of bland.  super easy. will make again
10/16/2016,5,We make this recipe every time we make Eggs Benedict.  We use a hand blender and an old pickle jar to mix all the ingredients.  We keep the jar of Hollandaise warm in the middle of the stove (of...
10/16/2016,5,I made this to go with the eggs Benedict casserole and it was a huge hit! Don't change a thing!
10/15/2016,5,ONLY changes I made was 1/3 tbsp of lemon juice (for 6 servings) and instead of liquid mustard I use dry mustard that you find in the seasonings aisle. I also omitted the hot sauce and added b...
10/12/2016,5,This is a  simple recipe and it's great. Thank you to the original cook who posted this. I use this recipe all the time and freeze any that's left over. I add dried tarragon 1/4 teaspoon of mu...

I had all of the ingredients needed for eggs benny - except..."
7/17/2016,5,Very good recipe.  I made this in the blender and thought it was r
7/14/2016,5,Delicious and so easy you'll think it's too good to be true. I've made this a dozen times now and usually leave out the mustard and Tabasco.
7/12/2016,5,Wow!  Couldn't be any easier.  Great recipe.  Unfortunately I didn't have a fresh lemon so I used juice.  I would cut the lemon in half next time if I were using juice.
6/12/2016,5,Hubby approved!
5/28/2016,5,Easy and quick!
5/26/2016,5,Perfect for our Benedicts and asparagus! Everyone loves it!
5/22/2016,5,Easy and very tasty. The lemon was a brightness. Now I need to perfect the poached eggs which ranged broadly.
5/10/2016,5,Tasty easy perfect. This is now my go-to Hollandaise recipe. I like to serve it over the Eggs Benedict Casserole by alycimo.
5/8/2016,5,guaranteed perfection every time! add lemon juice last so you can modify to taste
5/4/2016,5,Made this today for crab Benedict. Deliucios and soooo easy. Might use a lift!e less lemon and a little more Dijon next time.
4/26/2016,5,Followed recipe. Easy and delicious.
4/24/2016,5,"I omitted the dijon and put it on top of asparagus  ham and swiss crepes. 
If no one had been in the kitchen I probably would have sucked the leftovers out of the blender with a straw. 
So simp..."
4/23/2016,5,Better than 99% of restaurants Hollandaise sauce and super easy and fast!! I actually use Anna Maes Smokey Mustard(Rober Rothschild Farm) instead of Dijon which makes this 5/5 stars!!
4/8/2016,5,I've never made Hollandaise Sauce before and I am happy to say that this was super easy .I did add a little dried tarragon  to make it extra special.
3/27/2016,5,Wow! It was better than our local restaurants. One stick of butter did the trick.
3/25/2016,5,I used my bullet- it was done in 30 seconds!
3/24/2016,5,I have been making Hollandaise like this for years.  One hint - if the butter isn't hot enough and the sauce does not thicken just microwave at 60% power in 5 sec increments until it is the desi...
3/13/2016,5,Super easy! While the dijon and pepper are not necessary (sauce is delicious without it) I do like those additions. Excellent way to use up egg yolks and can be stored for a longer period of tim...
3/10/2016,5,I made this a few nights ago to go with buttered steamed asparagus. When my husband tried it he thought that I had spent a long time making it on the stove top! He even said that it was the best...
3/6/2016,5,I left out the dijon and hot sauce for a more traditional recipe.  Easy and delicious.
2/28/2016,5,I didn't have any Dijon mustard but I had read where another reader made it without it.  While it was great I would definitely use the mustard the next time.  This was my first attempt at maki...
2/24/2016,5,Easy and delicious.  Served over asparagus.  The family loved it and put the extra on their chicken.  Will definitely be making this again.
2/23/2016,5,This was the first time I've ever made Hollandaise Sauce.  I used 1/8 tsp of dried Chipotle Chili Pepper powder instead of a liquid hot sauce.  I used the sauce on some roasted asparagus and res...
2/10/2016,5,no changes... i make this all the time and it's quick easy and reliable!
2/9/2016,5,I followed the recipe exactly and was very pleased with the results.  I'll definitely use this recipe whenever I want hollandaise sauce.
1/26/2016,5,Sooo Good - Sooo easy! I left out the hot sauce as I'm not a hot pepper person.  This was Sooo easy in a Vitamix Blende!  Highly recommended!
1/24/2016,5,I have never made it before. It was easy and delicious. Just added an extra dash of cayenne pepper (or two).
1/3/2016,5,It's soooo easy to make! Didn't have mustard and I avoid all hot spices for health reasons.  I had eggs benedict ready in twenty minutes.
1/3/2016,5,Really happy with this never made hollandaise before and thrilled to make it without a mix.  I used a hand blender.
12/25/2015,5,Wow.  I have made Hollandaise Sauce for years using an old Betty Crocker recipe where you slowly cook the eggs by melting cold butter in a saucepan.  It always worked perfectly but took a long ...
12/25/2015,5,I lost my shortcut Hollandaise Sauce recipe (which does not use a blender). We always have Eggs Benedict for breakfast Christmas morning.  I was scrambling around to find a substitute recipe for...

12/24/2015,5,VERY easy recipe. I made it exactly as above and it turned out perfectly.
12/21/2015,5,Very good and simple. I heated butter in pan then poured it in then put it all back in pan to keep warm... Obviously I wasn't thinking cuz it cooked it a little more but it was still very good...
12/12/2015,5,EXCELLENT! Thank you for this wonderful recipe. Followed the instructions exactly and it was perfect. Super tasty :)
12/3/2015,5,Easy as pie and tasted fabulous!  Served it over roasted asparagus with fried eggs and bacon. YUM!
11/30/2015,5,Four egg yolks green sriracha and two tablespoons of lemon juice.  Best. Hollandaise. Ever.
11/30/2015,5,We love it. I use 4 egg yolks when I make this. And just add a little more butter. We always have some left over even though it doesn't look like a lot.
11/29/2015,5,Very simple and excellent taste. I had my doubts and was a bit slapdash about trickling the butter in but I kept the butter hot with quick return trips to the stove top and the result was a thi...
11/28/2015,5,Thank you.  It was delicious and the perfect consistency.  That was the first time I've made hollandaise without it separating.  I highly recommend this method.
11/27/2015,5,Easy and consistent
11/8/2015,5,Legit. Omitted the mustard (none on hand) and probably added more lemon than listed but it was deliciously tangy smooth thick and creamy. And very very easy.
11/1/2015,5,Omitted hot sauce and mustard in favor of paprika. Used salted butter.
10/15/2015,5,I have been to restaurant after restaurant and nothing compares to this hollandaise sauce. I refused to eat any other kind!
10/10/2015,5,This is amazing. ... I love how simple the recipe is.
10/6/2015,5,Absolutely amazing!  I didn't change a thing and it turns out great every time!  This is a keeper!
10/4/2015,5,Super easy! I used a bit more Dijon and added some paprika for color.  I also added a pinch of smoked salt since I wasn't using any smoked meat in my Eggs Benedict.  Will definitely make again.
7/7/2015,5,This is my go-to recipe for the holidays. I can always count on it coming out perfect!
6/25/2015,5,Tasted great and very easy!
6/14/2015,5,The BEST hollandaise sauce I've ever had!!
6/7/2015,5,this was delicious and SUPER easy! I will probably try adding a little warm water to thin it out next time as suggested but this was great. It's the second blender version I've tried and my fa...

3/4/2015,5,This is a perfect no fail recipe
2/28/2015,5,Easy as can be.  Tastes like the classic recipe it is.  Need the Dijon to make it so.  Great consistency using this method.
2/24/2015,5,Perfect! Used lime instead of lemon just cause that's what I had. Turned out delish!
2/15/2015,5,Great easy recipe and must for everyone! If you want to add a new twist use fresh lime juice instead of lemon... Then top you eggs Benedict with avocado & chopped cilantro...
2/9/2015,5,Yes this is a great and easy recipe.  The reviews panned the mustard and the hot sauce.  I used mustard powder and would also use cayenne.  So easy.
1/22/2015,5,This sauce was amazing. I don't know how using the double boiler method would make it turn out any better. Even my picky teen loved it!  I reminded me of the best tasting Hollandaise sauce I had...
1/17/2015,5,Excellent! I made as directed
1/4/2015,5,Bound well didn't break. The blender is the perfect tool to make fantastic hollandaise!  Followed the recipe to a T (warm tap water a must).  This one's a keeper.

12/20/2014,5,Awesome. This sauce came out the perfect consistency. I added a little more lemon some canned chipotles and a pinch of salt for more zip.  I like an extra flavorful sauce.   Will definitely ma...

11/9/2014,5,I'm never going to waste time with a double boiler again! I used regular mustard instead of dijon. End result was perfect and method couldn't be easier.

11/1/2014,5,Sauce was great! Used horseradish mustard instead of dijon left off hot sauce added nice little kick.
10/12/2014,5,This is GREAT.  Before I saw this I was so put off by the precision of the original recipe. The only ingredients I used were butter egg yolks and salt and doing the hot butter-blender-slow str...
10/12/2014,5,I follow this recipe to-the-letter and I'm never disappointed. I definitely prefer using salted butter.  I first made this with the Honeymoon Eggs Benedict from this site and it was perfect.  It...

8/21/2014,5,Awesome! Foolproof! Easy! :-) need I say more?
8/10/2014,5,Excellent recipe.   Consistency and flavor varies dramatically however depending on the butter you use.  For example if I use the Daily Chef brand of SALTED butter sold by Sams Clubs I get a...

7/27/2014,5,This was simply delicious and so easy to make. I was so surprised by the outcome! So good and so easy. No double broiler.
7/13/2014,5,Like many others I would like to rate this recipe much higher than 5 stars.  I had a family gathering and made 18 servings of eggs benedict.  If I had to hand wisk Hollandaise sauce for 18 the ...
6/29/2014,5,The Dijon addition is not traditional but I thought it was perfect.  This is silky rich easy and delicious Hollandaise.  My son loves broccoli dressed with this sauce.  He calls it cheesy sa...

5/13/2014,5,Used egg sub and omitted the hot sauce but still quite yummy.
5/8/2014,5,This is delicious. I used salted butter the recipe does not specify but I think it needs the salt. I also prefer a pinch of black pepper rather than hot pepper sauce.
5/8/2014,5,I have been using this recipe for years and find it easy and good.  Use a stick blender for easier clean up.  Use unsalted butter.  If you find that your final product is runny use four egg yol...
5/4/2014,5,So delicious and really easy to make.
3/26/2014,5,Great Recipe! This turned out delicious. I tweaked the recipe a bit. I used dried mustard instead of regular mustard omitted the tabasco and added a half teaspoon of salt.

3/22/2014,5,Great recipe really easy
3/12/2014,5,Very easy and delicious recipe!  The lemon flavor is great over asparagus for dinner but I reduce the lemon by about half for eggs benedict.  I just don't like that much lemon on my eggs.

8/21/2013,5,quick and easy tastes better then that packaged stuff I used to buy won't be buying that any longer.
8/11/2013,5,Easy easy.  And no double broiler...yes!  I used a smidge of sharp mustard in lieu of the dijon and it was great.  I will make this again for sure!

10/21/2012,5,Seriously better than most restaurant hollandaise sauce! I think the butter should be boiling though from the stove. Otherwise it isn't as thick as I'd like it.
10/13/2012,5,Excellent and easy.  Be sure you use fresh butter.  Used on My Crabcakes with poached eggs and English muffins for Crab Cakes Benedict.  A total winner! Would use again for asparagus etc. etc.

2/5/2010,5,This is a great recipe for a quick whip up on Hallandaise Sauce
2/1/2010,5,Excellent! Very easy very quick.  Perfect for Eggs Benedict!  Ensure you use butter!!!
1/21/2010,5,This was delicious!
1/10/2010,5,Awesome!! Made it without the dijon or hot sauce and doubled it because I was serving a crowd... My dad is a big Eggs Benedict guy and he said it was perfect!
1/8/2010,5,This was a huge hit at my New Years Day brunch. It was my first time making eggs benny and I was pretty intimidated by the egg poaching and the sauce.  This sauce got rave reviews from my foodie...
1/6/2010,5,Awesome and super easy!!
1/6/2010,5,Wow!  Goodbye double boiler!  Very tasty and quick!  I'm going to try this blender method with a mustard sauce for ham that I make that also incorporates egg yolks and a double boiler.
1/5/2010,5,This recipe was super easy and the results were great.  I liked that the sauce was not quite as strong as I had tried.  Can't wait to serve it to guests next time.
1/3/2010,5,Made my first hollandaise with this recipe and it came out great! I used my food processor and it came out just the same as if I used a blender.
1/1/2010,5,Delish!  Very simple!  Ate with asparagus and filet mignon... it was awesome!  Highly recommend.
1/1/2010,5,Never knew hollandaise sauce could be so easy - we served it over asparagus fried in olive olive and it was perfect!
12/25/2009,5,I have made a recipe similar to this minus the dijon and it is the BEST Hollandaise....I love how simple it is.  Would recommend to anyone who loves Holandaise and doesn't know how to make it.
12/13/2009,5,Why have I been slaving over a double boiler stirring til my arm was going to drop off??? this is so EASY and delicious!!! every bit as good as the Joy of Cooking recipe I have used for years. I...
12/1/2009,5,I've been following this recipe for years now. I've done the double boiler way worked in fine dining restaurants all over the U.S. that served their own and had my share at breakfast places - ...
11/29/2009,5,I don't know why I always bought those dehydrated packages of sauce. This was SO easy and delish! Thank you!!
11/13/2009,5,So much easier than I would have though!
10/25/2009,5,Best Hollandaise I have ever had actually...feels good to be the one who made it! :) Thanks!!!
10/20/2009,5,Quick Easy great flavor!
10/20/2009,5,I've never used a double boiler either and used a blender when my sauce separated but Chellebelle's method was a great idea to blend as a default.
10/17/2009,5,Wow!!! So yummy! I left out the tobasco and add a little more lemon juice for my personal taste...but otherwise this is delicious! Will use this over and over!!!
10/11/2009,5,Too easy to be this good!
9/20/2009,5,This was unbelievably easy to make. I thought it was plenty thick. My butter was extremely hot when pouring it in. I used the sauce on eggs benedict and it was really good although I am not enti...
8/31/2009,5,Finally a hollandaise sauce recipe that turned out excellent! I only wish I had tried this sooner - It was creamy not too lemony and reheated very well. Thank you!!
7/22/2009,5,Easy and fast! I am a chef and I shunned those that did not do it the old way on a double-boiler and I see I was wrong. You can get the same consistency with this easy recipe. Thank you.
7/21/2009,5,Very simple. Very good. I like mustard so I used a dash more. It made it very mustardy so stick to the recipe the first time to see if you like it. I love this sauce on a poached egg white and...
7/19/2009,5,I can't believe how easy it was!!!  1 and a half minutes from start to finished!  I will never buy Hollandaise sauce again!  YUMMMM!
7/11/2009,5,I like this recipe because it doesn't use two sticks of butter. I don't have a blender so I double boiled and stirred constantly instead. I used unsalted butter so I had to add a little salt and...
6/30/2009,5,made this again as it has become a family favorite super easy to make easy as a package to make thicker add less butter or more egg i use 4 egg yolks with a 1/2 cup butter makes it thick and fab...
6/8/2009,5,WoW!  Really just as easy as using the package stuff & just as good.
5/31/2009,5,This is by far the easiest recipe I've found and it tastes great!
5/30/2009,5,This is easy and very good. I got a lot of brownie points from April
5/17/2009,5,I made a 1/2 recipe (using 2 egg yolks) and a hand blender as suggested by previous comments. I needed Hollandaise Sauce in order to make a 1/2 recipe of the the allrecipes Asparagus & Mushroom...
5/10/2009,5,Really good hollandaise sauce. I used this recipe to make my Mother's Day Brunch for myself and family.
5/10/2009,5,Simple and easy.  I have used this type of blender recipe for decades and still love it.  I used it for eggs benedict but omitted the mustard and lightened up the lemon juice a bit.
5/3/2009,5,Easy and fabulous.  I agree with the poster who said the butter must be VERY hot when added for best thickening results
4/23/2009,5,I'd never had hollandaise sauce before but I made it for my parents anniversary breakfast and it was SO easy and tasted great. My parents loved it!!! Thanks so much for the recipe.
4/20/2009,5,I LOVE this sauce! It's SO easy and requires no special equipment or talent. It's turned out perfect every time. Fantastic with asparagus!
4/20/2009,5,I will never use a different recipe this is excellent!! Followed the directions to a t - it's better than the stovetop method for sure. next time i might sub pesto for mustard since i'm not a ...
4/18/2009,5,Thanks for a great recipe!  I used a small food processor and easily made a half recipe.  It didn't thicken up too well so I warmed it in the microwave.  It thickened unevenly so I just ploppe...
4/13/2009,5,Super fast easy to make. We thought it was a little bland as written so we added more lemon to taste. Great on asparagus!
4/12/2009,5,I really can't put a star value on this yetcuz I made this to what a user said and it turned out way to lemony. I'll put 5 though for great consistency and easiness. Anyways Do not listen to t...
4/10/2009,5,This was sooooo delicious! i ate half a pound of asparagus by myself because i couldn't stop eating the hollandaise. I had to add a bit of cornstarch to thicken it but besides that it was delici...
4/3/2009,5,Made Hollandaise this way for years using a food processor.  Butter must be nearly boiling to thicken the sauce.  Could eat this right out of the processor bowl.
4/3/2009,5,This has a great flavor and is SO easy to make!
4/2/2009,5,I made this last night with some baked Haddock and grilled asparagus.  It was stupendous.
3/29/2009,5,Very easy to make and delicious.  I made this to go with eggs benedict and it turned out great ! Thanks
3/23/2009,5,Quick delicious & easy! If you want to make only a 2 yolk Hollandaise as I did these are the measures: 2 yolks; 2 teasp. lemon juice; 2/3 dash Tabasco/hot sauce; between 1/8 & 1/4 teasp. of D...
3/15/2009,5,terrific easy preparation although the next time I would add salt and white pepper and more hot sauce.
3/8/2009,5,Didn't change a thing. DH said it tasted just like Hollandaise sauce and I thought is was very easy to make!
3/2/2009,5,I did omit the dijon mustard just because I didn't have any and it still turned out amazing and so so easy.  I will try it with the dijon when I get a chance to get to the store.  Amazing recipe...
2/27/2009,5,Tastes great and is super easy.  The second time I added a finely diced shallot to the butter as it was melting - added great flavor.
2/26/2009,5,yum! I made mine in a food processor and it was sooo delicious. Came out the perfect consistency. The first time i made it i tried to cut it in half but it didnt thicken right. I assumed it was ...
2/21/2009,5,We made this tonight for eggs benedict with smoked salmon.  It was easy and delicious.    We put it in the microwave on the warm setting.  It got it nice and settled for us while we cooked the e...
2/21/2009,5,I'm picky about Hollandaise and this recipe worked fantastic the first time! Couldn't be better. I didn't have Dijon but the spicy brown mustard I had was delicious in the recipe. To keep it...
2/20/2009,5,I made the mistake of not having the butter hot enough the first time and it was a little runny. The second time was perfect though! The butter just has to be bubbling hot!
2/14/2009,5,This is a wonderful recipe. Due to a mis communication between the griller and the indoor chef (me) I had to keep it for a long time after I made it. Although it got very thick it still tasted ...
2/14/2009,5,Super fast! Super easy! Super tasty! What more could you want? Thanks a ton!
2/11/2009,5,When my mom first got an Osterizer (in the '50s)she began making Hollandaise this way.  It is so light compared to the gloppy stuff they serve in some restaurants.  I once was pressed into makin...
2/11/2009,5,I'm not normally a fan of hollandaise but this was truly delicious. I made it to go with eggs Benedict and cleaned my plate! I didn't use lemon juice cause I really don't like it and since I did...
2/9/2009,5,Very quick very easy. The taste was pretty good too! Be careful that your butter isn't too hot or it can start to curdle the egg yolks.
1/31/2009,5,This recipe is SO easy and uses ingredients I had on hand which I love.  I served the sauce over Eggs Benedict and it was a hit w/my whole family!
1/25/2009,5,Wow this was so fast any easyIt allowed me to carry on with the rest of my preperation for my dinner.I will pass this on to friends Thank You!!!!
1/14/2009,5,I've always been intimidated about making this sauce. WOW! This worked just like the recipe said. Thickened up right away. Can't wait to use it again.
1/7/2009,5,Wow--this is delicious; I won't change a thing. However am I the only person whose blended ingredients flew all over the kitchen when I tried to pour the butter in while the blender was on high...
1/4/2009,5,Very easy straight forward recipe that gives great results.
1/1/2009,5,I have made hollandaise over a double boiler and I probably never will again after trying this recipe. So easy to prepare nice light flavor not too overpowering great consistency-airy and li...
12/25/2008,5,Delicious as is. My husband made this for me on Christmas morning with steam aspargus and an omelet. He said it was the easiest sauce he has ever made. The sauce was great on both!!
10/6/2008,5,This is honestly such an easy smooth and tasty sauce. If you want hollandaise this is it.
9/22/2008,5,YUM!
9/20/2008,5,Best Hollandaise Sauce Ever!!!! Way better than shop bought.
9/12/2008,5,Perfect! I left out the Tabasco because I didn't really think it would be necessary. It was great over Eggs Benedict. I will absolutely be making this again.
9/6/2008,5,Excellent and so simple. I skip the dijon because we don't care for it and it still comes out fantastic.
7/28/2008,5,This is super easy to make and tastes so good!  My husband is used to having his hollandaise sauce from the restaurant a bit blander and was pleasantly surprised to find out how full of flavor ...
7/22/2008,5,This is easy and works out perfectly.
6/15/2008,5,We make Eggs Benedict for every Mother's day and Father's day and have always used a store bought package to mix our hollandaise.  This year I thought I'd try it from scratch even though I'd bee...
4/15/2008,5,Easyquickexcellent! What more can I say ? Fattening with 1/2 c butter? Don't eat Hollandaise sauce then!!!! (And I watch my weight constantly but 1 or 2 times a year won't kill me!)
4/10/2008,5,If I could give more stars I would! This recipe is by far the easiest Hollandaise sauce recipe I have ever made. I like being able to control the spice in it too. I use Rooster Sauce(find it in...
4/9/2008,5,wow i didn't think it would taste as good as the double boiler method but it was perfect!  Just be careful when using lime instead of lemon juice like I did.  Lime is of course more sour so use...
4/8/2008,5,We use this recipe for every Benedict breakfast we make.  The taste is wonderful and the blender makes the recipe simple and quick. Thanks!
3/22/2008,5,"This couldn't be easier and very tastey.
Use right after making tho as it tends to cool off even when keeping in hot water. I will use this instead of the tradional way!"
3/6/2008,5,very delicious! I used margerine because I was out of butter still turned out great!! By the way if you don't mind tabasco I added 5 dashes came out with a nice zing!
3/3/2008,5,This was so simple.  My husband and I both loved this recipe.  No changes were necessary!  Thanks
3/2/2008,5,Very tasty.I had an upside down blender (one of those bullet type blenders) which I thought would be more efficient since it was a small quantity.  Even with putting things in all at one shot it...
3/2/2008,5,perfect tasting and very easy to create- thank you for sharing it!
2/26/2008,5,Excellent flavor and texture with the easiest preparation we've tried.
2/23/2008,5,Fantastic! Easy to make and really tastes like hollandaise. I add extra lemon.
2/17/2008,5,I just served this over poached eggs smoked salmon and a waffle - my boyfriend's favorite way to have benedicts.  The sauce was so good and the recipe couldn't have been easier.  Thanks for sha...
2/16/2008,5,Couldn't be simpler and great results.
2/2/2008,5,This is a great sauce if for no other reason than its ease of preperatioon. I didn't have dijon mustard so I used spicy brown. It's such a small quanity that I don't think it matters. I also did...
1/13/2008,5,first time I have made hollandaise sauce.  I made the double boiler to hot so keep it low. Other than that this was great.
1/7/2008,5,Perrrfect! Beautiful smooth lemony hollandaise sauce. And super fast.  Don't have to worry about constant whisking.  Awesome!
1/2/2008,5,This recipe is great!  Quickeasy and tasty.
12/9/2007,5,Wow pretty darn good Hollandaise and so simple & fool-proof.  I followed the recipe as-is for use over Eggs Benedict.  The recipe makes enough for 8 to 10 servings (at two eggs per plate and a...
11/13/2007,5,So Delicious So Easy!  Thanks so much for the new recipe.
11/11/2007,5,"This is the EASIEST on earth!  I am an experienced cook but I always shied away from Hollandaise.  But not any more.

We now have Sunday Brunch at our house and our friends go nuts over my Egg..."
11/4/2007,5,This is the easiest hollandaise recipe ever and very tasty.  I have been using this method for hollandaise for years and it always works as long as your butter is hot enough and you use at lea...
9/13/2007,5,Excellent- so easy to make. My husband was extremely impressed!
8/18/2007,5,Very easy and much better than the packet stuff!  Will become an eggs benedict and asparagus staple at our house.
7/16/2007,5,Can't imagine making it the old fashioned way ever again!  This is a fantastic find!
7/11/2007,5,Sooo easy.  Texture perfect.  Thanks!!
7/5/2007,5,Easy fast and great!  I needed a quick recipe for a last minute breakfast and this went over really well!  I am not a fan of hollandaise sauce but my husband thought it was delicious and he lik...
6/12/2007,5,soooo good and soooo easy!
6/10/2007,5,This was my first time making hollandaise sauce and it was so simple to make! The flavors are just the right balance and goes perfectly with savory crepes. I will definitely make this again and ...
6/7/2007,5,Very good and I made for the Chicken Breast Stuffed with Crabmeat recipe from this site and also for my asparagus.  Great accompaniment for these recipes.
5/15/2007,5,Followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious. This is so much easier than making hollandaise in a double boiler.
5/14/2007,5,I made this last night without the Dijon which I don't like.  I used 4 egg yolks and 2 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice along with the Louisiana hot sauce.  I did the 5 seconds in the blender...
5/14/2007,5,I love using this recipe and method.  Usually I change the recipe some and make a beautiful bearnaise sauce.  That is what I prefer on my steak oscar.  Sometimes I leave in the dijon for a diffe...
5/14/2007,5,Good stuff. Thanks for saving me a lot of hassle!
4/9/2007,5,I have struggled so many times to perfect this.  Great and easy recipe and was as good as if not better than what you would be served in a restaurant
4/9/2007,5,This works for me! I like the addition of a little dill weed.
4/8/2007,5,This turned out great... much better than the hollandaise packets or the cans you get from the store.  I didn't have dijon mustard so I used spicy brown (I don't know if there's a difference) a...
4/8/2007,5,This was a quick and easy hollandaise sauce.  Although I love hollandaise I rarely made it before because it was a hassle.  Making it in the blender is much easier.  I'll be making this often. ...
4/6/2007,5,I left out the hot sauce. It was the best . I will use it all the time.
3/31/2007,5,Quick and easy preparation. A nice subtle lemon flavor. I left out the tabasco. I was delicious over grilled steak topped with crab and roasted asparagus also known as Steak Oscar in most resta...
3/4/2007,5,Very yummy. Had a Sunday morning craving for Eggs Benedict with smoked salmon and this was the perfect sauce. Too lazy to dig out the blender so I whisked the ingredients the old fashioned way i...
2/11/2007,5,Delicious and easy!  Use the full recipe though as I only used part the first time and it didn't blend well with not enough ingredients in the blender.
11/5/2017,4,Great easy recipe. My sister in law always breaks the sauce when she helps me.  She doesn’t break this sauce.  Thank you.
10/21/2017,4,I found this kind of tasteless as written.  It could have been the eggs too though as sometimes store bought eggs  aren't very flavourful.  I had to tweak it with more lemon juice and cracked bl...
7/24/2017,4,The flavor was exceptional but the sauce ended up breaking in the blender.  I think I will just hand whisk next time.
6/24/2017,4,It was good - run the blender a little longer to make it thicker.
4/3/2017,4,I have been using almost identical recipe since the 70's. Mine doesn't call for Dijon and uses 4 egg yolks.  Be sure the butter is HOT or it won't cook the yolks and thicken properly.... to r...
3/28/2017,4,Made as the recipe called it.  It was definitely easy and pretty good.  It seemed thicker than I expected but tasty and good over Eggs Benedict.
3/6/2017,4,Great recipe without any changes.  The only problem was that there wasn't enough liquid to hit the blades in my bullet  so I ended up shaking it. But it was still delicious!
1/24/2017,4,Not perfect but for the time needed and ease it's pretty darn good. I also omitted the mustard due to taste preferences. I do prefer a slightly thicker texture and tangier flavour but I will ju...
1/3/2017,4,It had a little too much lemon/dijon flavor for my liking.  I will probably remake it with an extra egg yolk & butter.  I think that will even out the flavor more.  That said this recipe is ne...
12/25/2016,4,Wonderful!!!  I used a tad more dijon mustard.  Also used cayenne pepper instead of tabasco only bc I didn't have any.  Plus a used a hand mixer bc I don't like trying to get my finished produ...
11/30/2016,4,I've made this several times exactly per the recipe and it comes out perfectly each time and reheats very well (spooned over whatever and reheated in the microwave or sitting the dish of sauce i...
11/26/2016,4,The texture was perfect but will maybe add some more Dijon next time for some more flavour.
11/6/2016,4,Really yummy and SUPER easy. Always thought this was hard to make. I would recommend just a TINY little bit less lemon juice.
9/30/2016,4,So simple.  A 4 because it is just a little bland for us so we add more lemon juice this can thin it a bit but the hotter the butter the thicker the sauce  (and a little more spicey stuff depen...
8/29/2016,4,I'd use the stove for melting the butter not the microwave...had too many sauces not turn out right because the butter wasn't hit enough
6/26/2016,4,Um. This is blender-licking good. I've never made hollandaise before and I blended the sauce a bit too long (which I'm pretty sure is why it was thicker than it should have been) but it was ab...
6/9/2016,4,its great easy to make

3/27/2016,4,I really did enjoy this hollandaise sauce.  It was super easy to make.  The only change I would make is to add another tablespoon of fresh lemon juice to give a hint more tanginess.  Thank you f...
3/25/2016,4,Great recipe!  Really easy great consistency in the hollandaise.  The only thing I will change for next time is cutting down the lemon juice. I found that amount of lemon juice just overpowered...
3/6/2016,4,Easier/quicker than traditional method.  Tend to like a little less lemon juice in mine so I cut that back a bit. Would work better if one doubled the recipe so the yolks can blend better...but...
1/25/2016,4,This was really good and really easy but I'm not sure what I did wrong because it was REALLY thin and runny. But it tasted great I'm sure I will make it again!
1/23/2016,4,This was good considering it was made in the blender and was so easy but it didn't really compare to real hollandaise sauce. I used to make hollandaise sauce 3-4 times a week so it's not that...
11/27/2015,4,Great basic H sauce
10/25/2015,4,I found when following the recipe the finished product tasted overwhelmingly citrus.  The second time I adjusted the lemon juice to half a tbs. which significantly improved the flavor.
10/11/2015,4,Super easy! I've made it the old fashion way before but this was amazingly fast and no curdling risk!  I suggest using a mason jar instead of a huge blender pitcher if you have a regular blende...
6/10/2015,4,Yes !!!!! I Love simple and easy to follow recipes!! I was worried about raw yolks but it tasted just fine
4/12/2015,4,"Oh My Stars it was a hit!

1/10/2015,4,Easy.  Surprisingly good!  Thank you!

6/15/2014,4,"Overall I think it is very good.  Very easy to make but make sure the butter is not just melted but hot; otherwise it doesn't thicken.  Also the amount of butter has to be 1/2 cup as well.

5/25/2014,4,Delicious and easy. Followed recipe exactly and everyone loved it!
4/20/2014,4,Tested amazing. I had to put mine in a coffee cup in the micro for 30 seconds to get it to thicken though.
2/1/2014,4,Very easy and pretty good overall.
10/27/2013,4,I gave this 4 stars because it's a wonderful base recipe. I did change it to suit my taste: 5 egg yolks dash Sriracha 1/4 tsp dried tarragon dash black pepper. I kept the mustard. I used 3/4 ...
9/8/2013,4,I've been making Hollandaise in a blender for years but was drawn to this recipe because of the Dijon.  Dijon didn't seem to make any difference from the recipe I've always used and I missed th...
6/4/2013,4,I tried this recipe to go atop chicken cordon bleu.  I think it uses to much butter. I just cut the butter back and added some honey dijon mustard and it was fab!
4/30/2013,4,I'm re-reviewing this after making it a few more times. This really is an excellent hollandaise recipe with classic flavor using the blender shortcut. The most important thing to remember is to ...
3/31/2013,4,We really liked it but next time I will cut back some on the butter and increase the lemon juice to 2 tablespoons. Didn't have any Tabasco but it turned out great without it!  I will definite...
12/27/2012,4,I loved the flavor of this sauce but it did not thicken for me at all in the blender.  I had to transfer it to a double boiler.  Next time I'll just start out with a double boiler.  Thanks for...
6/29/2012,4,Easy!
6/28/2012,4,Great taste easy to make. It's a keeper
6/18/2012,4,This is a beautiful hollandaise sauce! I only give it 4 points because after tasting the original recipe I felt that it needed a bit more tang so I added an additional squirt of lemon juice an...
4/30/2012,4,Good. I did the blender until the butter and then the rest on the stove top.
4/24/2012,4,This was yum! Though I must not have gotten the butter hot enough (I read a review that said if it is hot and bubbly enough before adding to the egg mixture it should thicken up great) because...
4/4/2012,4,Really nice and easy hollandaise sauce.  I like to add a little cayenne instead of the hot pepper sauce.
4/1/2012,4,Very easy Hollandaise Sauce! I just got back from a glorious restaurant inn that made a fantastic sauce so my review is a little biased. I thought it had a great consistency and flavor however...
3/15/2012,4,So easy.  Tasted good.  Just what I needed quickly.  Did the job!
2/29/2012,4,Followed exactly and was very runny. Probably added butter to fast. The taste was really good but like i said. runny.

2/5/2012,4,Tried it with my hand blender turned out correct consistency.  Easy easy easy.
2/2/2012,4,Sauce was easy and tasty but I added a dash of worcestershire sauce to give it a little kick.  My family loved it :)
1/29/2012,4,Add a little pureed red pepper sauce to it.
12/25/2011,4,"Made this this morning with poached eggs for Christmas breakfast and it was soooo simple!  

I did make it without the dijon which was an accident not intentional - I wrote the recipe down i..."
11/26/2011,4,This had a great flavorand was super quick. Mine came out really thin though and I'm not sure why.
11/26/2011,4,was a little thin but very tasty and will definitely use again
11/21/2011,4,I liked this sauce.Nice lemon flavorfast and easy to make.
10/4/2011,4,Turned out great! Hint.....make just before you need the sauce. I was silly and thought I would heat it up a bit in the microwave just before serving...the egg cooked and ruined it :( Started ov...
10/3/2011,4,So easy and so good! I did a small batch of this and served it over eggs. I don't make hollandaise very often but this will be my go-to recipe when I do.
9/4/2011,4,"I'll try this again (way too watery) maybe really heating the margarine or using real butter.

On second attempt it was better."
8/2/2011,4,Great flavor! Took the advice of other reviews and halved the recipe; it was perfect! Tried to blend it in my magic bullet and will definitely do it in a real blender next time! Thank you for sh...
7/20/2011,4,Easy easy and good consistency.... lacked a little flavor.
7/10/2011,4,Quite tasty.  I used bottled lemon juice so doubled the amount and used 4 yolks.  Heated butter in microwave until popping and sizzling.  Just as good as double boiler method although a little t...
5/15/2011,4,This was DELICIOUS! And super easy and quick to make. The reason I only gave it four stars is because it was too thick but that might be because I used fresh eggs which are a bit denser. I made...
5/8/2011,4,Had this made for me this a.m. for Mother's Day.  It was very good.  Probably cut back on the mustard next time. That is the first taste you get.  After that you don't notice it much anymore but...
4/24/2011,4,I made it as is and the dijon gave the sauce an odd flavor that no one liked.  I made it again with 4 eggs and 2 T lemon juice-much better.  I will use this again with the slight adjustments.
4/11/2011,4,Pretty good but it could use a little more flavor.  I think I'd leave out some of the butter and add more Dijon and lemon juice and maybe even some Worcestershire sauce next time.  Because of t...
4/1/2011,4,Thank You!!!
2/28/2011,4,I've been using this recipe for decades and it always comes out perfect! By far the easiest holladaise ever. You do lose a little bit of the depth of flavor you get using the double boiler metho...
2/26/2011,4,This was great!  It was my first time ever making hollandaise and I'll admit I was nervous but it was for naught.  Did everything as written except that I subbed Franks Red Hot for Tabasco.  D...
2/2/2011,4,Very easy but a little bland.   I'm surprised it didn't call for any salt or Worcestershire sauce.   I'll be adding that in next time.
1/20/2011,4,The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because I followed the directions to a T and served straight away but the sauce still didn't seem warm enough.  Other than the temp this was wonde...
1/17/2011,4,I would give this recipe 5 star except for one thing the sauce was a bit thick; however you'll probably never experience the separation you may experience with other Hollandaise recipes. I bel...
12/17/2010,4,This was good I've never made or even had hollandaise sauce before. Mine turned out more of a dark yellow (but I think it was b/c I used our fresh chicken eggs). Very easy and simple to make I...
11/28/2010,4,I have never made Hallandaise before and this was yummy and super easy!
11/20/2010,4,Just tried this Hollandaise sauce this morning for eggs Benedict -- quick easy and much better tasting than the package mixes!
11/11/2010,4,Awesome easy sauce kind of bland but with a bit of salt and pepper it picked right up!
10/24/2010,4,Added a bit more lemon (since we prefer it that way) and it was delicious!  Very easy as well.
10/2/2010,4,I am impressed very easy; tastes good yum!  Thanks will use again.  Great for Low-No carb people!
9/25/2010,4,No dijon mustard so I used Worchester sauce instead. As I was also using bought lemon juice rather than fresh so needed to add extra to overcome strong taste of free range egg yolks. I prefer a ...
7/7/2010,4,Have been doing the low carb thing and was craving Hollandaise but did not want to cook!  This recipe is excellent - I added a dash of Worcestershire sauce. Yum.  Excellent w/eggs & canadian ba...
6/27/2010,4,I really liked the ease of this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and thought it tasted too buttery for a hollandaise. After it was completed (and tasted) I added about another 1/2 tsp. dij...
6/26/2010,4,Fast and easy!
6/3/2010,4,It thickened well but some bits were stronger on the lemon than others don't know why.
5/1/2010,4,my first time making hollandaise sauce and never thought it would be this simple! I did cut the the butter a bit and like other reviewers said the sauce wasn't hot enough so i gave it a 4. The s...
4/19/2010,4,I don't know what I did wrong but the sauce didn't thinken for me. It tasted good though and I'll definitely try again!
4/4/2010,4,The true texture and flavor of this Hollandaise Sauce is amazing! Next time I will add a little less lemon juice and a little more mustard. I used regular since I was out of dijon which worked...
3/29/2010,4,I was amazed at how true this hollandaise sauce turned out- it really had a great texture and was super easy to make. I think next time I'll use less or a different type of mustard because it wa...
3/10/2010,4,This was my first time making Hollandaise sauce - it was easy and turned out great!  I added about half a teaspoon of dried dill YUM!!  I put it over steamed asparagus and I'll put it over scra...
3/9/2010,4,Great easy hollandaise recipe just a little too much lemon and a little on the cool side needed heating up.
2/28/2010,4,This was really good considering I wanted it in a pinch. Used real lemon juice and did the whole thing in a 6 storage container w/my immersion blender. Reheated ok as well. Very thick.  Someone...
2/21/2010,4,I tried 4 different recipes and they were all disastrous. Finally this worked!
2/2/2010,4,This is a really fast and easy way to make good Hollandaise sauce especially if you don't have any packages of the sauce on hand.
1/30/2010,4,Loved the ease of the sauce and the amount of time to make it.  Made it as the recipe suggests and thought it needed to be a thicker.  Good flavor but next time I will try some of the suggestio...
1/2/2010,4,I made this as is with margarine instead of butter due to allergies. I added cornstarch as it didn`t thicken with the melted margarine but when I zapped it in the microwave to heat up it got to...
12/29/2009,4,GREAT!! The hot sauce makes all the difference!!
12/19/2009,4,Easy and tasty. My only problem was that the egg yolk didn't seem to get incorporated with the butter completely and everything cooled off REALLY quickly. There was egg yolk left in the bottom o...
11/11/2009,4,hooray for this!  super quick and easy.
11/10/2009,4,this was really quick and easy.  i'm not a fan of hollandaise so i can't comment on the flavor but my wife and mom both seemed to like it on their eggs benedict.  i would use it again. it certai...
11/8/2009,4,Super easy..  the butter must be VERY hot for it to thicken.  Added about 1/4 teas salt for flavor (I think seasoning salt or Cajun seasoning would work well & will try this next time)  and subs...
10/30/2009,4,Eggs benedict has always been an item we only eat in restaurants--not any more! This hollandaise sauce is so simple--made exactly as presented here it turned out wonderfully. I have also added s...
8/2/2009,4,I'd never made Hollandaise before and decided to try it on a whim to top steamed broccoli - turned out great. I had a hard time keeping it warm in water though and it scrambled a bit. I guess ...
6/14/2009,4,this was excellent! Not as thick as i was hoping but really easy to make and tasted perfect
6/4/2009,4,Easy great tasting hollandaise sauce!
5/18/2009,4,Easy and tasty. I halved it for 2 people using 2 yolks 1/8 tsp dijon juice from 1/2 a lemon 5 Tbsp butter and 1/8 tsp cayenne in place of the hot sauce.
5/18/2009,4,It was a little bland so I added dill seed and tarragon to bring the flavour up.  Otherwise quite good - thanks!
4/27/2009,4,This was great. It took just a minute to do instead of 10 with those little package mixes that have no taste.
4/11/2009,4,if the rating was based only on ease of preparation this would definitely get 5 stars however as is the final result not thick enough for our liking and we did not care for the dijon.  I will ...
3/22/2009,4,Very good as written.  I found the addition of dijon a bit too tangy along with the lemon juice.  I have since used 1 teaspoon of cream in place of the dijon to wonderful results. Very creamy co...
3/2/2009,4,i was nervous the egg yokes weren't cooked enough but otherwise this was so easy.  I don't have blender but worked well whisking it.  I've never made eggs benedict before but IT tasted very aut...
2/27/2009,4,Not bad at all.  Definetly worth it for the amount of work required.  Could use a little more lemon.
2/21/2009,4,This recipe saved me at the neighborhood potluck!  A quick steaming of asparagus and zip-zip this recipe in the blender.  DONE!  In less than ten minutes.  If you need to reheat the sauce before...
2/15/2009,4,great and easy hollandaise sauce.
1/11/2009,4,i love the way this recipe is ready almost instntly. i used to use a tradition recipe...when i would add 5 or 6 tblspns of swearing to get the sause to thinken and not seperate...
11/16/2008,4,Very decent sauce that is quick to make.  Next time I would decrease the lemon.  I thought it could be a little thicker too.
11/10/2008,4,This was my first attempt at making my own Hollandaise sauce and it came out very nicely!  I used it over some fresh steamed brussels sprouts and the taste of this sauce was a nice compliment t...
9/4/2008,4,the sauce turned out great but i think for my personal taste i'll skip the mustard next time.
6/28/2008,4,had a little tang but great easy sauce.
5/17/2008,4,It was not the best hollandaise i've ever tasted but because it was so easy I gave it 4 stars.
3/23/2008,4,Really buttery. I wouldn't make this if I was worried about my saturated fat intake! Very easy to make...thickened up nicely. I used it over asparagus.
3/15/2008,4,I have never had Hollandaise Sauce so I have nothing to compare this to. I thought it was good. I served it over a toasted english muffin with poached eggs and ham. Thanks for posting this simpl...
2/27/2008,4,This was easy and yummy!  I'm not a big fan of super lemony sauces so I cut the lemon juice in half and it was perfect.
2/15/2008,4,This was super easy quick and a great consistency even though I used only three tablespoons of butter rather than the full amount.  I'm giving it four stars because I thought it was bland so I ...
2/14/2008,4,I needed a quick easy sauce bearnaise so I substituted tarragon vinegar for the lemon juice & added 1 tsp. dried tarragon to the egg mixture.  Had a bit of trouble getting the sauce to thicken...
2/7/2008,4,The first time I made this the taste and texture turned out great. The second time I think my butter wasn't hot enough to thicken the mixture so it made my sauce turn out really runny. I highl...
1/12/2008,4,Very easy I actually liked the taste and was able to make it work.  Have tried others which are nearly impossible to keep from seperating.  This one is a no brainer.  A little too much lemon j...
12/26/2007,4,I have made this recipe twice. The first time it came out perfect. The second time the sauce broke creating a gooeey unsightly looking mess. I did pretty much everything the same the only thi...
12/13/2007,4,Excellent and easy.  This was my first attempt at a hollandaise and it was very simple.   I think I will try the double boiler version to compare but this tasted like anything I've had in a rest...
11/22/2007,4,Quick and easy.  If you can seperate eggs and run a blender you can make this.  A little too lemony but still good.
11/5/2007,4,Good but make sure to use UNSALTED butter.
10/21/2007,4,The only change I would make for this recipe is not quite the full amount of lemon juice...was just a tad on the too lemony side...otherwise easy foolproof and just as good as any restaurant!
8/4/2007,4,Terrific served over poached salmon or eggs benedict. The fact that it is cheap quick and easy makes it a definite keeper.
8/2/2007,4,I didn't follow the recipe procedures however I followed the ingredients.  I tried to whisk it instead of blending it.  It turned out thin so I took it to a double boiler and it turned out fin...
7/20/2007,4,I like the idea of making Hollandaise in the blender but hate the fact of putting it in the microwave
6/17/2007,4,Not quite like my mom's but so much easier.  I thought it could have been a bit thicker.  I omitted the mustard and hot sauce and used white wine instead which I prefer.
5/6/2007,4,It needed a lot more lemon but it was super quick & easy.
3/31/2007,4,A very good recipe and it will thicken nicely if the butter is bubbling  hot when it is added to the running blender in a slow stream.  I have been using this recipe for over 30 years!
2/14/2007,4,It was a pretty good recipe but the blender thing didn't work so well. I added about 1/4 to 1/2 c. milk to give it a better consistency. Also about a pinch or so of dill and a dash of cayenne p...
4/11/2017,3,The recipe was okay but I had to add cream as recommended by the other readers. That a little too runny for my flavor.
2/25/2017,3,I made this recipe by the directions. Although there was nothing bad about the recipe the four of us participating in the taste test found it to be dull and boring. I will try to jazz it up wit...
5/23/2016,3,I have made this twice and both times the sauce didn't thicken as the recipe says... Can you please help me to find out what I did wrong?  I read somewhere that using unsalted butter would be be...
9/27/2015,3,I prefer the traditional method in a pinch it was ok.  I didn't like it with the mustard and tabasco sauce.  I tried it again leaving those ingredients out and adding a pinch of cayenne instead...
2/13/2015,3,it separated too much and tasted overly citrusy
2/10/2013,3,We made this twice and both times were less than par. It was to rich and mustardy for us.
1/19/2013,3,I made this as shown and it separated and wasn't very flavorful. It did the trick for this breakfast but will use another recipe next time even if I need the double boiler
1/13/2013,3,I made this recipe exactly as it is written. I normally make a blender Hollandaise sauce so I expected it to be easy and perfect as usual.  However when I served it it was very bland. I reali...
12/19/2012,3,Ran out of the mix and didn't feel like running to the store. It was alright but I still prefer the Knor mix.
11/23/2012,3,I am going to give this one another try because I'm pretty sure I was the problem. First I made it way to far in advance and kept it in a warm water bath. It got much thicker than hollandaise sh...
7/30/2012,3,I've made this one twice now.  First time a 1/2 recipe and the second time a full recipe.  While the TASTE of this hollandaise is excellent it's totally runny!  It has the consistency of soup....
6/26/2012,3,This was fast & easy but needed at least double the lemon juice and a big dash of hot sauce so it won't be so bland.
2/21/2012,3,This did not thicken hardly at all for me. I cook a lot and the directions are straightforward so I don't know what the deal is. I heated my butter until it was bubbling and poured it in a thin...
10/18/2011,3,Not like real hollandaise but easy enough if you have a craving for some!
8/8/2011,3,I made this and it tasted good but it didn't thicken enough and I'm not sure it got hot enough to kill any microbes in the egg.  I didn't measure the the temperature but if the eggs and lemon et...
7/25/2011,3,Followed recipe exactly as written. The end result was okay. Its very easy but I thought it was a little too lemony and too runny. At first I didn't like it but it tasted better on the eggs bene...
6/19/2011,3,This was my first time ever making Hollandaise my second time ever eating it and eggs benedict I think this is my new fave breakfast. I had it at a Rest. last week and theirs tasted a little...
2/24/2011,3,Good basic recipe easy to execute but way too lemony.  Didn't taste very much like the Hollandaise sauce I buy in the store.  Will try it again though with less lemon juice.
1/16/2011,3,Used hard margarine instead of butter and it was effective... but did not provide the same kind of taste.  Needed a bit of salt and lots of pepper.
10/8/2010,3,It's WAY better without the Dijon or Tobasco! Sharp mustard brings this classic delicate sauce down several notches into so-so territory. (It's kind of like spoiling a deviled egg with Miracle ...
10/3/2010,3,Tasted great but I couldnt get the sauce to thicken? Will try again!
8/27/2010,3,The consistency was perfect howeverI thought it tasted flat.  I think with an increase in lemon & the addition of salt and pepper it might improve this sauce.  I will try it again as I do pref...
8/15/2010,3,This was fast and easy but I found the flavour was lacking something.  I used Wor sauce rather than hot sauce but that was the only change.  I may use again when in a pinch but I think I wil...
6/28/2010,3,I don't care for hollandaise sauce but I made this for my father on Father's Day... He said it tasted good- like normal hollandaise sauce but the uncooked eggs made me nervous.
4/17/2010,3,It tastes great and is very easy to make but a little too much lemon flavor and I just can't get past not cooking the eggs.  Seems like the eggs need to be cooked.....that's why so many recipes...
4/4/2010,3,Hard to keep warm though yummy!
10/22/2009,3,wasn't wow like i thought it would be. also didn't like that the yolks were not cooked.
8/16/2009,3,So easy to make and that's the best part of this recipe. To me it was too buttery and not lemony enough so I adjusted accordingly.
5/10/2009,3,This was really easy to make but the taste was really mellow. A lot like authentic hollandaise? probably what it's supposed to taste like. But I am spoiled by restaurant and packaged hollandaise...
3/18/2009,3,This was very easy but it lacked flavor.  The lemon should be doubled.
2/2/2009,3,Didn't hate it but didn't love it either. Tasted like runny lemon butter. Maybe its something I did but I doubt I'll be trying to make it again.
9/7/2008,3,*huh* I do not know if I may did something wrong but this did not taste at all like the comforting Sauce Hollandaise I know from home (Germany). It was more like a buttery eggsauce and pretty bl...
5/18/2008,3,Very very easy and really quick but I found it a little bland.  I added thyme and rosemary used tiger sauce instead of hot sauce (it's all I had) and added a drop of lemon extract.  That gave ...
5/5/2008,3,flavor was okay but what a mess! anytime i tried to open the top of the blender even the teeniest bit to pour the butter egg yolk spurted everywhere. next time i might try using my kitchen aid...
1/28/2008,3,I had some problems getting the sauce to thicken but the flavor was good.
5/16/2016,2,I made this as a quick alternative to a tradional Hollandaise sauce for use on a crab benedict.  The recipe thickens just like it should but overall I found the flavor to be bland and to lac...
11/2/2014,2,There's no real taste to it and the mustard made it worse. I added extra lemon juice and salt to make it taste. The amount is not as advertised. I had enough for one serving. The blender also wa...
8/6/2012,2,For me this hollandaise was just okay it wasn't like the stuff you get at restaurants. It was fine on our eggs but not what I was looking for.
6/16/2011,2,I wasn't impressed.  Very runny.
7/25/2009,2,tried this twice couldn't get it to work. hubby didn't hate it but did not taste like hollandaise. wish I knew if I did something wrong
10/17/2008,2,Did not care for this. Hollandaise sauce is the one thing i like better from a package
6/3/2008,2,I gave this 2 stars because it didn't have a bad taste but it just wasn't a hollandaise sauce at all to me.  It wasn't much more than a medium for distributing butter and not really an effecti...
1/5/2008,2,This was actually quite bland compared to other hollandaise sauces that I've made. Even though it was thick and smooth it lacked enough. I'd definitely add more lemon juice salt pepper ands...
4/16/2017,1,I followed the directions.  The consistency was good but the flavor was seriously lacking.
4/16/2017,1,I made this recipe for Easter morning to go with our hard boiled eggs.  It set up very runny and the mustard was just too much.  Wouldn't make this again.
11/30/2016,1,It basically tasted like what it is.....raw egg whites w/ butter & lemon.  Did not thicken much at all and no flavor.  And slimy.
1/3/2016,1,I did not like this recipe at all. It was too sour.
12/13/2015,1,i was a 2 star my husband 1. It was too thick i think it needed more butter and lemon juice.  i think the dijion was too over powering
11/28/2015,1,Did not care for sorry
8/12/2015,1,I'd rather spend the time and have traditioal holladaise. This is more like mayonaise imo.
12/22/2014,1,Major food safety issues here! If you are using unpasteurized eggs you need to add more lemon juice (2 more tablespoons) to kill off the Salmonella. Holding this as is at a warm temperature wil...
11/16/2014,1,"Absolutely terrible. My hollandaise never thickened and then separated once I put it on my eggs. 

I'm so furious."
8/28/2014,1,It did not turn out good for me. I went by the directions but it was too much butter. There are many good ratings. I must have done something wrong.
8/5/2014,1,I just made this recipe this morning; did not care for it at all.  I knew instantly that my family would not like it soooooo I doctored it up a bit; I added a dash of granulated garlic powder; ...
6/15/2014,1,Sauce was sour tasting.
1/1/2014,1,I tried this recipe using a wand mixer and it turned out way too watery. I was very disappointed. I then tried the recipe for the microwave hollandaise sauce and it worked so much better as far ...
8/11/2013,1,This was actually the most disgusting thing I have tried in my life. The colour and texture looked right but it tasted like lemons and sour milk. I followed the recipe to a tee. I had to scrape ...
5/25/2013,1,I had a hard time with this receipt. It did not thicken at all.
1/25/2013,1,The sauce separated and I did not care for the flavor.
1/25/2013,1,What did I do wrong? mine would not thicken!!
8/27/2012,1,I did not care for this hollandaise at all niether did my husband.....I will never make this again. Sorry to be a Debbiedowner but it was way to thick an just not good at all. I would have rathe...
7/8/2012,1,I have tried it multiple times w/ heating the butter until bubbly or not adding the butter more slowly or when it's warmer using fresh or bottled lemon juice fresh or older egg yolks differ...
1/24/2012,1,I am a good cook too I wanted to try something a little different than the norm.  I would have rather had a packet to make instead of this.
9/8/2011,1,I made this twice and both times and didn't come out.  I don't know what I did wrong.
7/19/2011,1,I honestly don't know why there are so many 5 star reviews. I have had Eggs Benedict many times in restaurants and this one was not to my liking. Not the savory flavor that I'm used to. I follow...
12/12/2010,1,I followed the recipe minus the mustard tried it and did not like it.. added the mustard.. and did not like it. I was really excited to try this as we have eggs benedict often and always use th...
8/17/2010,1,way too much butter
3/10/2010,1,i love hollandaise and usually just use a mix....wanted to try to make the real thing but this was inedible. maybe it's just me i don't know....
12/24/2009,1,This just didn't work for me.  It did thicken up but the flavor just wasn't there.  I've had better flavor from a package
1/26/2009,1,i have tried a lot of recipies from this site.  Remember easy does not mean good.  Very bland.  If you dont have the time to make an actual Hollandaise Sauce go buy a can instead.
8/16/2011,5,This was excellent and quick. I also used Knorr Hollandaise mix and added lemon juice and a little bit of tarragon. I used chicken breasts that I pounded out a bit. My fiance' thought it looked ...
6/7/2011,5,A great easy recipe (only had chicken thighs). Nice for company.  A keeper!
3/18/2010,5,Fab recipe loved it! As suggested added lemon juice and tarragon to the sauce as well as salt and pepper.  Used fresh green beans since I didn't have Asparagus.  Pounded turkey breasts sprinkl...

11/8/2007,5,We had this for last night's dinner and it not only was picture perfect but also delicious.  As suggested by a prior reviewer I used skinless boneless chicken breasts which had to be pounded a ...
10/14/2007,5,My turkey cutlets were thin so they came out a little tougher than I liked but otherwise the flavor was wonderful.
12/30/2006,5,This turned out great.  We used left over white turkey meat cut thin.  Turned out great.
2/26/2004,5,My husband and I loved this dish!! I followed the recipe exactly. I served it with salad and crispy bread. Looks Great! Will make again!! Thanks.
1/19/2004,5,What a great idea! I made this as directed except I used 1 lb fresh asparagus for 4 people instead of the frozen.  The finished producut looks especially impressinve!  We were not that impressed...
6/3/2015,4,Made with chicken thighs and it's pretty darned good!
8/21/2014,4,A tasty dish!  I didn't change anything but next time instead of the turkey cutlets I'm going to use pork cutlets.
6/1/2008,4,We all enjoyed this dinner. I also steamed fresh asparagus like other reviewers. The sauce could have used some lemon juice and I will try it again with that addition. I also tried 1/4 t. dried...
4/14/2008,4,Good recipe but the hollandaise packet needed a little spicing up.
4/5/2008,4,I was a little bit skeptical about making this recipe.  I was thinking turkey and shrimp in the SAME dish? How could that be? It actually turned out pretty good.  Really fattening though but h...
8/2/2007,4,I used chicken instead of turkey butter instead of marg and fresh asparagus. This was good but the packet Hollandaise sauce I used was pretty blah. Thanks Colleen!
7/28/2007,4,I'm giving this a four because the recipe has good beginnings. I used boneless chicken breasts because I feel that turkey can be a little dry and I believe that fresh asparagus is a must for th...
1/13/2007,3,I thought this was okay it wasn't bad but it wasn't good enough to make very often. My 8 year old daughter loved it but I think she'd eat anything smothered in hollandaise sauce. I used fresh...

7/16/2016,5,Cracking! Made for evening meal and served warm. Used water rather than beer and reduced salt because I only had salted butter. Used German bockwurst rather than hotdogs because that is what my ...
6/29/2016,5,This is a great game day recipe!  I have even replaced one cup of the bread flour with one cup of whole wheat  flour and it turns out  good every time.  The family loves these!
5/30/2016,5,These were so easy and so good! I didn't have beer so I just used water. They had a bit of a baking soda-ey aftertaste but that was not a huge issue for me I may have put too much. I'm not pick...

3/20/2016,5,Love this recipe. Delicious
2/8/2016,5,The dough was great to work with!  I was a little intimidated but it wasn't so bad! I made the dough and wrapped the dogs a day in advance then baked them the next day. Will definitely make th...
2/7/2016,5,These are awesome! I do not own a bread machine nor do I wish to ;-) I used a mixer and let the dough rise on its own. Also I only did 6 dogs so I made pretzels with the extra dough- cooked th...
12/12/2015,5,So delicious! We wrapped 10 hot dogs and used the rest of the dough for pretzels. Everyone was happy.
10/23/2015,5,Beautiful look great can't wait till my hubby sees them.  Very easy to make when you have a bread machine.
9/7/2015,5,These were really good

12/31/2014,5,Excellent! A little time consuming but well worth it. Don't change a thing on this recipe. Makes even cheap dogs taste good!
12/9/2014,5,Delicious and not too hard.  I also used my kitchen aid with a dough hook.  It was faster than using the bread machine.
9/6/2014,5,Nice pretzel dough. You can't taste the beer which in my case was a good thing. The pretzel covering was perfect. Nice texture and it got a really nice golden brown when in the oven. Will defini...

12/31/2012,5,Never tried something like this before.  Rave reviews from family and it wasn't that hard.  I was hesitant about using beer as I have had beer battered foods before and didn't like the taste o...

12/15/2012,5,Love love love these. Simple to make just has a lot of steps. I do not use a bread maker just my Kitchen Aid and I use the dough hook for about 4-5 min. I did not change the recipe at all. T...
12/7/2012,5,These were awesome! Just make sure you find the lowest sodium hotdogs you can find or they will be very salty. I plan on make these many times over. Thank you for the recipe.
11/30/2012,5,What a great idea! My family really enjoyed this. The pretzel dough is perfect. Very easy to but together. The only beer I had in the house was a Guinness so I used that. Will be making these ag...

5/8/2012,5,These were so good. I can’t believe I made pretzel for the first time. I dried the pretzels with paper towel before I baked them. Instead of salt I put cheddar cheese on the top. I also put jal...

3/25/2012,5,My husband and son (3 yr old) loved these!  DH kept saying they taste much better than dogs on a plain bun.  He loved them with brown spicy mustard.  I cut the recipe down to 6 servings; my doug...
3/24/2012,5,LOVE these!  The pretzel part is top notch and taste just like the hot pretzels you can buy.  You must use the parchment paper...no sticking.  I baked them at 425 which helped them not be so bro...
3/17/2012,5,Follow as stated and you HAVE to put in baking soda water it makes the whole thing work GREAT!  These freeze well for later use.   Thank you
3/11/2012,5,Fantastic!  The dough is so easy to work with!  Don't be afraid of stretching it if needed to get it all twisted around the dog because it will not break.  This is a very elastic dough.  I don't...
2/11/2012,5,"This was good.

The only thing I am going to suggest is that you add the baking soda to the water before it boils. I added it after it boiled as the recipe stated and it was like a volcano. Th..."
2/8/2012,5,This came out absolutely great! I put in half whole wheat and half white flour and it came out quite nice.  I also don't have a bread machine so I kneaded by hand and left it to rise for an hour.

2/3/2012,5,Loved these!
2/3/2012,5,I took these to a bowl game-watch party and they were a huge hit! I cut the hot dogs in half to make small versions and that was a perfect size.  Word of caution: DO NOT use a hard-anodized pot ...

6/16/2011,5,AWESOME!!!!! These were almost too simple to make. I halved the recipe for 1 package of hot dogs and actually made my dough the night before and refrigerated it. A couple of hours before I was ...
6/16/2011,5,I made this recipe for the first time back before it was published and my family loved it. I used both hot dogs and smoked sausage links and both were great. They freeze well too!
6/16/2011,5,Yum yum! These couldn't have been easier to make. I halved the recipe and ended up with enough dough for 8 hot dogs. The taste is amazing. The pretzel dough on it's own is so good. Thanks for su...
2/9/2016,4,These were a hit at my super bowl party.  I think I'll not sprinkle the kosher salt on the top next time.  Made it a little too salty.  Might add other flavors to the top like cheddar bake some ...
9/29/2014,4,These were super easy and fun to make.  I'm not a hotdog fan (so I'll adjust rating if hubby goes nuts) so I wasn't completely blown away by taste ... but presentation wise they're adorable.  ...
9/4/2013,4,4  stars only because it was difficult. It truly is one of the best tasting Pretzel dog recipes however very labor intensive and the boiling was difficult the dog would slide out or the pretz...
3/3/2013,4,That wasn't bad. not hard to make nice little treat. probably won't make it again not because we didn't like it but when it all is said and done that was a lot of work for a hot dog. Made 7 ...
2/4/2013,4,"These came out SOOO good and are much easier than you'd think.  A couple recommended tools:
Breadmaker (yes the recipe says this but if you are like me you are guilty of making a shopping list b..."
8/19/2012,4,Good for what they are you can wrap it up but it's still a hotdog!  The kids liked them and the dough was easy.
7/10/2012,4,these were good but I used cheap hotdogs not a good idea. Would have been great with better dogs
4/2/2012,4,These were good.  I used parchment paper -- first time ever and the LAST time!  ALL of my hotdogs stuck to the paper and ruined the bottoms.  Pretzet was nothing outstanding but good for a chan...
12/16/2011,4,They didnt turn out like I wanted but it was probably my fault.  Still tasted good but not as much like a pretzel as I was hoping
12/7/2011,4,An excellent recipe.  I didn't have enough hot dogs when I made this and so there was too much dough for the amount of dog but everything still tasted ok.  I was worried about it cooking in the...
11/6/2011,4,Used the KA stand mixer to mix and knead.  Great way to combine the flavor of an all-American hot dog with a soft pretzel.  Made a half-batch with Ball Park beef hot dogs and ended up with some ...
8/6/2011,4,I boiled half of the wrapped hot dogs and then I just baked the other half without boiling them.  We all preferred the non- boiled ones.  I do not know the purpose of boiling them but it changed...
7/28/2011,4,These are very tasty and the dough is beautiful to work with but I don't have a bread machine so they were a little more labor intensive for me.  As some others mentioned the bottoms browned ...
6/21/2011,4,These were very easy to make.  However I didn't use the 1/4 cup kosher salt to sprinkle on top and they were still way too salty for our family's tastes (I used Oscar Mayer Angus hot dogs).  Al...
2/29/2012,3,Thought the dough was a bit too chewy.  I would also use less baking soda.
11/8/2011,3,To be honest it tasted like a normal hot dog (in a regular bun maybe a little saltier. But at least it looked nice. :)
5/31/2012,2,This IS NOT an easy recipe! This took FOREVER and produced mediocre results. NOTE: You need a bread maker for this recipe!
8/29/2011,2,had trouble with wrapping the dough around hotdog. i think it was due to the fact the dogs were wet.  i will try next time with 5 star weiners or brookside. forgot to add my salt with sugar and ...
8/21/2011,1,I followed the recipe closely but something must have gone wrong.  It was quite a bit of work and it was nothing like a pretzel.  I did not particularly enjoy the beer flavor in the bread.  I d...
9/15/2017,5,I've made this several times and it is always a hit!! I followed the recipe except I used dried parsley and oregano rather than fresh.
8/17/2017,5,Like many others I used cilantro.   Be sure to add a bit of lemon to the avocado to prevent it from turning brown.
8/4/2017,5,No need to change  anything!  No cilantro!!!! Its is perfect the way it is!!!
7/23/2017,5,I put this on top of spinach.  It was the best spinach salad I ever had!
7/6/2017,5,Awesome! The only difference was I used cilantro instead of the parsley.
6/11/2017,5,Amazing.  Couldn't get fresh herbs and it was still fantastic.  As well used jarred feta stored in the freezer
6/9/2017,5,I love this recipe. I used dried oregano and parsley adding the same amounts that the recipe called for without thinking but I still thought it was amazing. A little high calorie for a side sa...
4/5/2017,5,I made this as is and it was great!!
2/20/2017,5,Awesome salad....great addition to any wrap/sandwich. Followed recipe exactly except I used dried herbs cuz I didn't have the fresh stuff.
1/23/2017,5,Turned out a bit more mushy than anticipated but it's still amazing. The flavors are great.
1/2/2017,5,I followed the recipe pretty much exactly and couldn't believe how good it was! I will definitely make it again!
10/9/2016,5,I saw the suggestions and used 2 large avocados 3-4 cloves of garlic  and cilantro instead of parsley (probably less feta). Delicious and fed three hungry adults generously as a salad with din...
8/18/2016,5,Absolutely amazing! I added more avacado and seeded cucumber  slices in small chunks ! It was a hit!  I placed salsa on a bed of lettuce and had for dinner too!
7/25/2016,5,I made this exactly as the recipe stated. I used this as a side dish with steak and potatoes.  Its hardy taste stood well with the rest if the meal. I am not a fan of traditional salads made wit...
7/24/2016,5,Sooo goood!!!! I doubled the ingredients putting more tomatoes (I used little datterini). I used two and half avocados 2 fresh basil leaves lemon juice instead red vinagre pepper salt. My fr...
7/14/2016,5,absolutely loved it. Made as is except for cilantro I used parsley instead (personal choice I do not care for cilantro) and now this is a staple at all my family summer cookouts!
5/22/2016,5,This recipe was awesome.  I made it with a couple of suggestions from reviews.  I used more  avocado cilantro instead of oregano and parsley and a squeeze of lemon juice.  It was the best!! I ...
4/25/2016,5,I made this exactly as the recipe called for.  Used as a side dish and was very impressed.  Thanks for the recipe!
3/10/2016,5,So delicious!  I add a half of can of black beans and the bowl was empty!
3/2/2016,5,Made this a while back for a get together with some friends. They absolutely LOVED it! Will definitely make again... And again... And again.
2/12/2016,5,I was looking for a nice healthy after school snack and this was perfect! I am a big fan of feta tomatoes and avocados. The red onion was a little strong for my taste but other than that it ...
12/14/2015,5,Very good! I used white wine vinigar and dried herbs because thats all I had but I cant wait to try it with fresh!
11/23/2015,5,Delicious! Used fresh oregano parsley and cilantro not having enough growing of the first two. Had it as a side dish with a baked salmon patty and pilaf.
11/9/2015,5,Everyone loved this recipe! I have made it a couple times so far for get togethers and it's been a hit! No changes either made it exactly as the recipe calls. Makes it even better because it's q...
10/2/2015,5,Perfection!
9/13/2015,5,This is an amazing salsa if you love avocado. I didn't have any oregano or red wine vinegar so i used balsamic instead and it turned out wonderfully. I'll have to get some oregano for next time...
9/4/2015,5,Always receive rave reviews when I bring this to an event.
8/30/2015,5,Super Good!!! Will definitely make this again!!!
7/11/2015,5,I'm going with 2 good sizes small avocados as 1 large isn't enough and and 2 would be too much.  It's so good you can eat it as is.
7/7/2015,5,Tasty fresh and healthy.  I served mine inside toasted pocket pitas so the salsa was more of a sandwich filling.  This recipe keeps for several days so if you don't mind the avocados turning...
7/6/2015,5,I will make this again and thanks for a salsa recipe that doesn't have the demon herb/weed cilantro.
7/5/2015,5,Delicious scrumptious and so refreshing. Made this for a party and the salsa was gone in a snap. The freshness of the ingredients and the creamy texture of the avocado and feta cheese make for...
6/9/2015,5,Made this a couple of weeks ago to take to my sisters birthday party.  Everyone LOVED it!  I did go with what other reviewers suggested and used basil instead of oregano but that was the only ch...
5/23/2015,5,We loved this. I added cucumber and served with chips and crackers one time. Then I added shrimp mango cucumber and lime juice and served it over a bed of spinach as a salad. Again it was a b...
5/10/2015,5,Tastes amazing.
4/3/2015,5,My family fights over this salsa! There is never enough for leftovers :(
3/15/2015,5,My guests never get tired of this tasty treat.
1/24/2015,5,I love this recipe.  I make it without the feta because it is not needed.  The recipe is so good without it and that is saying a lot because I am a cheese lover.
1/21/2015,5,5 starts as is - the feta is a nice touch.  This is also a great topper for tacos burritos etc.  I added another avocado as recommended by other reviewers and about a cup of seeded cucumber to...
1/13/2015,5,Delicious! Just needs some salt but otherwise no need to change a thing!
1/5/2015,5,This is so good and addicting.  I served at a party and it was gone within minutes!
12/21/2014,5,Simple + healthy + flavorful! This is something we enjoy eating with a fork and it's versatile enough that I can put some on a warm tortilla.  I added green onions but otherwise make this recipe...
11/22/2014,5,I love this! Also family and friends at work love it! and many have asked for the recipe or ask me to make it again.  I usually use 3 plum tomatoes. And I double the entire recipe because everyo...
11/1/2014,5,Really good with crackers
7/30/2014,5,This recipe is fabulous. When in a pinch for an appetizer and you don't have fresh tomatoes I have used canned tomatoes that are seasoned with green chilies garlic/basil or whatever I have on ...
7/27/2014,5,My 13-year old niece made it (minus the garlic) the evening of 7/26/14.  It was delicious with tortilla chips!
7/5/2014,5,Fantastic salsa recipe. The feta and avocado get the attention but you can also use fresh cilantro or even basil to change it up. I always get rave reviews and recipe requests when I take this ...
6/15/2014,5,What a huge hit!  Definitely use 4 avocados and some cilantro.  The biggest suggestion I can make is to not put the feta cheese in until you serve it or it gets soggy and milky and ruins the bri...
5/10/2014,5,I just started eating avocados recently. But this recipe has turned me into an avocado addict!! Oh this is so good! I took the other suggestions and added cilantro and lemon juice. I even added ...
3/15/2014,5,Added some shredded  romaine lettuce and used 4oz fetta instead to cut out  some fat.   Toasted some pita chips to serve along side.  Turned this into a heathy lunch
3/9/2014,5,Added a little lime juice and chopped coriander instead of parsley. Served with Key West Chicken (also on this site) and it worked perfectly. Very tasty and easy to make.
1/22/2014,5,I made it with cilantro instead of the other herbs some fresh lemon juice and I added some kalamata olives....it was great.
1/20/2014,5,Amazing!  Added black olives.  Got a 5 star rating from my husband :)
1/11/2014,5,Did it the first time exactly as in the recipe and it was great. Second time I used lemon juice and cilantro. I prefer the second way.
12/6/2013,5,Three words for this salsa - yum yum yum!  I made this on a whim as I had all the ingredients.  It was far better than I was anticipating.  I took this to work and served it with bagel thins a...
12/2/2013,5,So good and quite easy too. I added an extra avocado and threw in a little chopped bacon I had leftover from something else I was making. Thank you!
11/28/2013,5,Super super quick.  Great substitute if if you make guacamole too much like us!
11/16/2013,5,Amazing! eveyone loved it!
10/29/2013,5,Delicious! with tweaks recommended by others-sub cilantro and use 2-3 avocados.
9/6/2013,5,One of the best appetizers I have ever made!  Everyone at the party wanted the recipe and I left with an empty bowl :)
8/14/2013,5,Add one more five star rating to this fabulous recipe!  I only had time to let it chill for about 1 hour and it was still delicious!  I subbed cilantro for the parsley but otherwise followed th...
8/5/2013,5,Fabulous! I added a can of black beans and I had everyone asking me for the recipe!
7/4/2013,5,My goodness....this is just the absolute best summer dip ever.  The blend of all the different flavors is so unique and delicious! I struggled to find the right food to dip and settled on some l...
5/24/2013,5,So yummy!  I used white vinegar and left out the onion and garlic.  It tastes even better the next day!  I will definitely be making this again.
5/20/2013,5,I used cilantro instead of the parsley and only had dried oregano on hand but it was awesome!
5/5/2013,5,Loved it and so did everyone I shared it with. I used more avocados and cilantro instead of parsley and then ate so much of it I didn't have room for dinner! Thanks for posting this!
5/2/2013,5,Absolutely yes this is a keeper!
4/14/2013,5,Excellent dip!
4/13/2013,5,This is so amazingly simple and yet DELICIOUS! I used a touch of apple cider vinegar and a splash of lime juice. Amazing. Will be making again! (I ate almost the whole serving in one sitting!)
3/5/2013,5,SO GOOD! I used dried spices (to taste) and sweet onion (that's what I had on hand). Great flavor...a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)
2/24/2013,5,Delicious!  I served to my women's game group and everyone raved.  This is one of my go to recipes now when I have to take a dish that's quick to prepare for a potluck.  Always popular.  the ava...
2/8/2013,5,Great recipe. Feta adds such a unique flavor so I use more than what is called for. Not sure how some posters thought it did not add a special flavor because to me it totally changed the taste. ...
2/3/2013,5,I loved this even before it had a chance to chill and meld together.  I had only cilantro so substituted that for the parsley.  Loved the feta.  It added the perfect finish.  Think next time I ...
2/2/2013,5,Awesome.  Had a guest eat 3/4 of it in one sitting it was so good.  Didn't change a thing.
1/8/2013,5,Wonderful!  It does need 1 more avocado than stated.  I serve with pita bread that has been cut into triangles and broiled.  That really adds a great element.
1/6/2013,5,Made this for a party last night it was GONE in a short time.  I don't really like feta cheese but made the recipe as written (except subbed cilantro for parsely.) It was really really good. Yo...
1/1/2013,5,Love it! Thanks!
12/29/2012,5,I love this.... Add Cilantro and 2 Avocados or more :)   I agree with DC Girly Girl.... Black beans and corn would be perfect addition.  No picture bc it didn't stick around long enough!
11/21/2012,5,I'm not going to lie... this stuff does not look tasty.  Especially if you opt for the red wine vinegar.  We had a bowl of it on the floor once to snack on while watching tv: the cat took a look...
11/21/2012,5,Served this at a party. RAVE reviews. My Mother-in-law kept saying - this is delicious and I don't like guacamole. My mother who has probably never eaten an Avocado requested this as a pre-T...

10/8/2012,5,I made this for two socials now and have been asked for the recipe several times.  I too substituted the cilantro for the italian spices.  I own a blooming onion chopper (as seen on TV) and us...
10/2/2012,5,I didnt think the feta would go well with avocado but this was outstanding!  I will make again for sure!
10/1/2012,5,I made this to go with chicken tonight and I will do this again. I had no red wine vinegar so I used cooking sherry. My daughter who is a vegetarian enjoyed this with tortilla chips.
9/28/2012,5,So yummy!!! Always a crowd pleaser!! I have tried it with super ripe avocados and pretty firm ones.. Both were very good but I think the less ripe is better. It looks prettier and it's nice to d...
9/20/2012,5,Delicious but dangerous... I ate half the bowl myself. Does not keep well so plan on eating it all.
9/18/2012,5,LOVE this salsa!  Only made 2 *small* changes: 3 cloves of garlic instead of 1... and dried parsley and dried oregano instead of fresh.  (I used about 1/2 tbsp. of each because of this substitut...
9/17/2012,5,This salsa is awesome!! The only thing I changed was I put cilantro instead of the parsley and oregano and added lemon juice. So yummy!
9/14/2012,5,This is AMAZING. I would knock down my own grandmother to get at this stuff. I hear a lot of people omitting the oregano and adding cilantro. I'm a cilantro fan but the red wine vinegar and ore...
9/4/2012,5,My family would give 20stars for this!!! It is very very tasty. The only thing is - we really doubt the number of servings. In my opinion it's maximum 4 servings! Unless it is a starter for 5 d...
9/2/2012,5,Rave reviews as expected based on the previous reviews!  I doubled recipe added an extra avacado substituted cilantro for parsley & oregano added lemon juice and served with tortilla chips. ...
8/1/2012,5,LOVED IT!!!!  This was definitely a huge hit when I made it.  Delish =)
7/31/2012,5,This was awesome! Like earlier reviewers I used cilantro instead of parsley and oregano. I used 2 avocados and added a can of drained black beans. I would have added frozen or fresh corn if I h...

7/5/2012,5,Made it unchanged and then as reviewers suggested with extra avacado and subbing cilantro for parsley and oregano 4 stars as written 5 stars when changed. This recipe is definitely a keeper!
7/4/2012,5,phenomenal!
6/28/2012,5,Great taste my family loved it!
6/17/2012,5,This is an award winner as is. We serve it at every competition tailgate and the judges go crazy for it. Use ripe but not overripe squishy avocados to make chopping and assembly easier. If you w...
6/8/2012,5,This salsa is awesome!!! But as other reviews noted sub cilantro
6/5/2012,5,Yum!! This is a really great enhanced guacamole with a lot of awesome flavors. I served it at a party and it doesn't look as appetizing as guacamole does so I'd recommend serving it only at a s...
6/2/2012,5,Amazing!!!  I did change it a bit did the cilantro instead of parsley as I love cilantro and that's what I had in my fridge.  I also used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar.  It is th...
5/26/2012,5,I omitted the oil - it turned out fantastic. It was the first thing that was gone at the bonfire. Will definately be making it again.
5/26/2012,5,A fresh and light dip. Everyone ate this dip up so quickly I almost didn't get to try it for myself! Super easy prep. I followed the recipe except I used fresh cilantro instead of oregano. Will ...
5/8/2012,5,"hands down the best dip I've ever had. My boyfriend was CONVINCED he didn't like avocado and he's begged me to make this for him almost every day. 

Made this for my family for a trip home e..."
5/7/2012,5,Wow!  This was amazing.  I'm now calling it guaca because it's a blend of salsa and guacamole and pure heaven.  Although I did make a few changes to the recipe.  Instead of parsley I substit...
5/4/2012,5,I didn't add the oregano or parsley and put it in a wrap. This was a great summer treat!
4/29/2012,5,This is awesome....I make this once a week. Love it!!
4/26/2012,5,I love this.  I like to call it Greek Guacamole.

4/12/2012,5,LOVED this recipe!  Made it for a beach picnic with friends & it was a hit!  Only changes I made were - left out parsley and oregano and added cilantro. Delicious!
4/3/2012,5,This stuff is amazing my family went wild for it!  I followed the recipe exactly and it was fantastic!
4/2/2012,5,This dip is amazing and don't count on leftovers!  I usually use 2 to 3 avacados in this recipe
3/19/2012,5,I've never made guacamole without using the instant powder mix that goes in it. This was soooo good!! Took readers advice & used fresh cilantro instead of parsley & oregano. Used minced garlic t...
3/9/2012,5,Amazing good!!!  Really really really good and full of healthy vegetables.
3/4/2012,5,I have made this a couple times and got great reviews from friends/family! I used fresh cilantro in place of the oregano/parsley...and added more avocado and tomatoes to my liking!
2/5/2012,5,Yum!  I bring this to work for lunch and it's great.  I use fresh mozzarella with basil in it instead of feta cheese.  Bring some nuts along and you've got a nice healthy well-balanced lunch.
1/29/2012,5,Can't get enough of this salsa. I've made it many times for at home gatherings or work functions. It goes over well every time!
1/19/2012,5,I have not personally made this but did eat it!! By far one of the best dips I have ever had. I prefer a white corn chip with it. Also there was cilantro in the one I had seems odd for this re...

1/10/2012,5,Love it!
1/8/2012,5,If you love feta and avocado this is excellent!
1/7/2012,5,This was like a magnet at a party. It's a beautiful plate of green and tastes healthy. It ended up being the first appetizer gone even though it was the last opened.
1/2/2012,5,Excellent!
12/28/2011,5,This was a real hit! I added more tomato avocado and garlic. I did as others suggested and used cilantro opposed to the oregano and parsley I also added a few jalapenos. It was gone in no time...

11/11/2011,5,Everytime I make this dish for a get together it practically disappears in what seems like moments. I always have to quadruple the servings if everyone is to have a chance to try it. This was th...

9/20/2011,5,Easy and a great change to Salsa.  We love brushetta and salsa and this was a great in between for us.
9/19/2011,5,This was really good! However I doubled the recipe and it still only made a very small batch.  I would triple or quadruple if making this for a larger group of people.  Will definitely make aga...
9/15/2011,5,AMAZING! I substituted cilantro for oregano. It tasted incredible as soon as I made it- after it set for 2 hours... it blew me away! A must make! I will add this as a staple in my home and share...
9/13/2011,5,This is SO good that my 10 yr old who never would eat avacado actually tried and liked it!! These are great flavor combos. Took to a pool party and was gone before the first round of people ate!...
9/9/2011,5,This was good. Ate with round flour tortilla chips.
9/2/2011,5,I tweaked it a bit and used 3 avacados and garlic/herb feta cheese (it's what I had on hand).  This recipe is fantastic!!  Even my children gobbled it up!
8/29/2011,5,"The feta cheese creates an AMAZING contrast of flavors with the tomao onion CILANTRO (not parsley) and avocado.
WE ADDED: 2 or 3 TBS of V-8 Juice and about 1/2 TSP of hot sauce. MUCH better!"
8/28/2011,5,LOVE IT! This is a nice mix between salsa and guacamole. The cubed avacado is a nice change from ordinary guac. I made a double batch but used three avacados. I think the feta cheese is vital to...
8/26/2011,5,Delicious! I used this as a condiment on a turkey sandwich and it was great.
8/23/2011,5,Thought I created this myself....added a little balsamic made it a bit saltier.  But all in all this is a great recipe.  Should've looked here first.  Friends loved it..very flavorful refresh...
8/21/2011,5,This was so delicious!!! I wouldn't change a thing!!!

8/18/2011,5,I made this last weekend and it was delicious!  I used roma tomatoes and dry herbs.  Yum!  This is definitely going to be a staple around our house.
8/15/2011,5,This is awesome as a side dish as it is more of a salad than a salsa imo. I skipped the garlic and used dried parsley and italian herbs but whatever you do don't skip the feta that's what ma...
8/15/2011,5,Awesome awesome awesome.  Enough said.
8/14/2011,5,a great change up from your standard guacamole!!

8/14/2011,5,Turned out fantastic! Wonderful dip. Only thing I changed was I didn't have fresh oregano so I just sprinkled a little in. I also put in fresh cilantro in place of the parsley. Loved it! Perfect...
8/14/2011,5,The Avocado Feta Salsa is amazing. I did use the readers suggestions and used cilantro instead of parsley. You can top a salad with this and forget the dressing...it is that good!
8/14/2011,5,"Definitely Add Cilantro instead of parsley and also we added a couple of Jalapeno chopped.  Its hard
to wait for it to chill.  We were ready to eat it right
away. Also Lime squeeze. YUM!"
8/13/2011,5,Great summer dip to eat with corn chips or pitas. Very easy to make and full of flavor.  We made a batch tonight and before our guests arrived had to make a 2nd one! I'll make this again!!!
8/13/2011,5,This is very tasty.
8/13/2011,5,Love this!
8/13/2011,5,I think I'm in love.  I used 3 avocados (instead of 1) and fresh cilantro instead of parsley and oregano.  I also added about a couple of ounces of lime juice.  Wonderful with baked tortilla chi...
8/13/2011,5,This recipe is delicious and fresh. I also like to add chopped almonds for an extra crunch.
8/13/2011,5,This is just over-the-top delicious!  I took the advice of other reviewers and substituted cilantro for parsley and oregano; I also used three avocados and three plum tomatoes.  Do yourself a fa...
8/13/2011,5,i make this all the time.. it is a hit every time The only thing i do different is I use a little of Ken's Northern Italian dressing instead of the seasoning and olive oil.
8/1/2011,5,I made this last weekend for a party and it was a huge hit! I took the advice of other reviews and used four small avocados instead of just one. The first time I made this dip I didn't have any ...

7/18/2011,5,Amazing!  Always a big hit and can be used as a dip in fajitas or tacos or even a side topping to steak or chicken done with a citrus or cilantro marinade.  Yummy in my tummy!
7/18/2011,5,It was great!  I used 2 avacados dried herbs (teaspoon of each) and I had sun dried tomato feta.  I made my own pita chips.  I came home with an empty bowl
7/15/2011,5,I made this for a babyshower and it was a huge hit. I used more lime juice and avocado than it called for but also threw in a green pepper for a little more crunch.
7/9/2011,5,Loved this salsa! I did two avocados instead of one and used 1 tsp. dried oregano since I couldn't find fresh. It was delicious! I may try it with cilantro instead of parsley next time but onl...
7/9/2011,5,Huge hit!  It was the first appetizer to get completely devoured and I was asked for the recipe several times.  This one is a keeper.  Nice change from regular guacamole.
6/27/2011,5,Everyone could not get enough.  I was asked to give the recipie.  I will definitely be makeing this again.  I did not put the oregano but instead put double the cilantro.  Next time I will add m...

6/6/2011,5,I would never have thought to put avocado and feta cheese together but this salsa is awesome!
6/3/2011,5,"I loved this. But I love garlic.  I don't think you will like it if you don't like garlic.  I skipped the onion.. not a fan. 

I actually ate it as a salad. I think would be a good bruschetta...."
5/17/2011,5,Excellent and quick - add a squirt of lemon for extra dimension!
5/5/2011,5,Received rave reviews when I made this for a family gathering.  Didn't alter anything and just posted on Facebook to share with my family members who requested it.

4/20/2011,5,This was delicious!  I followed others' suggestions and skipped the parsley and used cilantro and added a bit of lemon juice.  Otherwise I stuck to the same ingredients.  Delicious!!
3/21/2011,5,I give the original salsa about a 3.  I used 4 avocados 4 oz. of feta cheese and 3 plum tomatoes.  Then when I added the lemon juice and cilantro it still just didn't have enough taste.  I happ...
2/23/2011,5,This is soooo good! Do NOT change the avocado to feta ratio it is perfect (this is not guacamole it is completely different).  Parsley is not completely necessary or can be substituted for cilan...

1/1/2011,5,I made this when I was hosting book club one month and the girls raved about it.  They all insisted I shared the recipe with them.  Definitely a winner!
12/31/2010,5,This appetizer was delicious!  I did what many reviewers suggested and used cilantro instead of oregano and parsley.  I also love avocado so I used 2 or 3 of them.  To make it more colorful and...

7/13/2010,5,My mom makes this in the summer time (not sure where she got the recipe... but it's the same) and it disappears VERY fast.  I recommend making a double batch.

5/23/2010,5,WOW. I made roasted garlic and spread it over my home made pizza bread after it came out of the oven for dipping. This salsa rocks. My family went crazy for it. Will be making it again soon.
5/18/2010,5,I made a variation of this for a side dish to go with chicken. I added chopped cucumber and corn. Didn't have feta but I'm sure it'd only be better with it. Nice textures and a variety of flavor...

3/23/2010,5,A great twist for guacamole lovers.  I did find that I had to drain some of the tomato juice once it had set in the fridge for an hour to chill.
3/22/2010,5,Hubby said this is a dish he'd expect to get in a restaurant.
3/17/2010,5,We're asked for the recipe for this every time we make it.

12/16/2009,5,I debated whether or not to try this one because everyone seemed to think it needed cilantro. I personally think cilantro is the most horrible green thing on the planet. For those of you who fee...

3/6/2009,5,I decided to try this only because the reviews raved about it. I had my reservations about the feta but OMG! I loved this stuff. My hubby is not a salsa or Guac fan. I made this and gave him a ...
3/2/2009,5,Fantastic!  I used cilantro instead of fresh parsley and oregano.  Not pretty but so tasty!
3/1/2009,5,I can't stop eating this when I make it!  I add a bit more feta and try to get the avocado's before they are really ripe.  Love this one!
2/20/2009,5,Easy to make and a big hit at the party! Will make again
2/19/2009,5,I first tried this recipe over two years ago. It's still something I make atleast once a month and several friends have taken the recipe and used it as well. I think overtime I've also added mo...

1/27/2009,5,I just made this for a party and it was gone to the point that someone took a chip and scraped the sides for more!  Many asked for the recipe and it turned out great!
1/20/2009,5,Every time I make this I have to double it because it is always the first thing gone on the appetizer table. Thanks for the great recipe!
1/16/2009,5,At first I was a little hesitant to try this recipe (the feta threw me off). But oh my gosh I am so glad I did! The flavors blend so well together. Whether I'm making it for a party my family...
1/12/2009,5,This was amazing! Per many recommendations I used an extra avocado lemon juice instead of olive oil and cilantro instead of parsley & oregano. It was gobbled up!

12/28/2008,5,Wondeful!  I followed the recipe except I had basil feta on hand so I used that with a little less spice.  Everyone loved it.  I served it at a christmas function and it was very festive with th...
12/19/2008,5,Every time I make this dish it's the first empty bowl on the table. I get requests for it whenever there's a get together. I follow the recipe to a tee and it turns out tasty every time.
12/13/2008,5,Great recipe for any party!  Everyone is asking for more!!!
11/22/2008,5,Outstanding!  Wish we could go higher than 5 stars because I would.  I did use the fresh oregano as written.  I liked the different flavor for a change.  Outstanding recipe!

11/6/2008,5,Absolutely delicious and addicting (a comment from one of my guests).  I used fresh cilantro instead of the parsley.  I LOVE cilantro.  I served with light pita chips.

10/26/2008,5,This recipe is great as listed !   what is nice is that it lends well to changing depending on what I have on hand.  Always a winner!
10/21/2008,5,I really loved this recipe. When you're making it though be certain not too accidentally add more of the vinegar than it says. It produces a lot of heat if you do.
10/20/2008,5,"This is the BEST snack and company loves it!!!
Works great with pita chips and I certainly don't mind eating any leftovers if there is any!"
10/19/2008,5,Outstanding flavors!  Made recipe to the T and everyone loved it!  Only lasted about 30 minutes at a party for 7 people!  Next time I'm doubling or tripling the recipe!

5/19/2008,5,This was really good. I think it would have tasted even better a slightly less ripe avacado as mine got pretty mushed up while stirring everything together. I also think it needed just a little...

5/7/2007,5,Fantastic. It's very flavorful and it's definitely a party pleaser.  Just don't expect it to taste like Guacamole.  It's more of a salsa/dip.
4/13/2007,5,this was very good but i wouldn't call it a 'salsa' but a chunky guac.  I made it for my book club and it was all gone - and I doubled the recipe!  I used clintro instead of parsley and green on...

2/13/2007,5,Yum yum easy & healthy! Used 1 t. dried parsley & oregano in place of fresh.
2/12/2007,5,Wow! I just made this salsa and it is so great! I don't even know how it tastes after chilling in the refrigerator because it didn't make it that far.
2/2/2007,5,Fantastic. No changes necessary although we've found that cilantro makes a good substitute for the parsley. This has quickly become a favorite dip at parties.

11/29/2006,5,This recipe rocks! Added cilantro instead of the parsley and a bit of fresh squeezed lemon. In my opinion you can't have salsa without cilantro. Much much more tasty that guacamole!
11/12/2006,5,This one tasted great.  I made it without the feta though.  Still tasted great.  I left the house for an hour and when i came back everyone already ate it all
11/5/2006,5,AMAZING it gets eaten up first at every party.  Definately make the same day the basil wilts it you do it the day before and doesn't have the same taste.  SO GOOD!

8/8/2006,5,This was wonderful!  Very well received by my family and friends.  Thank You!
7/30/2006,5,Excellent-- I agree this is more of a guacamole than a salsa. It's really good I think the cheese is the kicker. It turns the recipe into something more than ordinary.
7/30/2006,5,Don't change a thing in this recipe - it is superb - have yet to find someobe who does not love it.
7/29/2006,5,I took this to a party and it disappeared before I could even taste it.  Every time someone saw me they said wow that salsa is great.  It's that good!  I added a lot more tomatoes and substit...
7/21/2006,5,This was VERY good however I would not consider it a salsa as it was more like a guacamole with a kick we thought.  But we all LOVED it!  Maybe next time I'll try adding another tomato and a...

4/6/2006,5,This was really good.  i didn't have fresh parsley or oregano so i used dried.  I thought there was to much feta however my husband thought it was perfect.

1/15/2006,5,Great salsa!  I added cilantro (about 1/3 c)instead of parsley.  I also sprinkled a bit of lemon juice.  The oregano and red wine vinegar were suprisingly tasty in this salsa.  Will make again!!!

7/13/2016,4,Tasty & easy to make.

7/3/2014,4,This was really very good. I added an extra avocado and about a half cup of fresh corn cherry tomatoes instead of plum sweet onion instead of red and some fresh basil. Put everything together...
6/24/2014,4,This is fantastic!.  I hate cilantro and nowadays finding good salsa is more difficult without it.  This is positively delicious exactly as written.  The only slight difference I changed was to ...
2/20/2013,4,I would call this Italian Guacamole... You're basically taking a classic dish and replacing cilantro with parsley and oregano and adding in a nice addition of feta cheese.  It is nice to have...
9/26/2012,4,I liked the the recipe in its original form though I REALLY liked the recipe after I made some changes based on preference. As recommended by many reviews I subbed cilantro for Oregano/Parsley...
9/13/2012,4,Loved this! Would give 5 stars after the changes i made from other peoples reviews. Must use cilantro!! Mince the red onion used lime juice and a dash of cumin.
9/9/2012,4,Loved it. I swapped the parsley for cilantro and used fresh lime juice instead of the vinegar.  I also added half a jalapeño for a little kick.
7/16/2012,4,It is hard to make this a salsa as the avocados need to be very firm so mine ended up more like a chunky guacamole with feta but still good.  The onion has to be very finely chopped.  I used...
6/28/2012,4,More of a guacamole than anything.  Served on chicken tacos
3/22/2012,4,I can’t even say rookie mistake…it was just a plain old mistake not to read the reviews before making this.  I had fresh oregano in the fridge so I went with it.  As soon as I tasted the salsa I...
12/18/2011,4,very tasty just as is.  I smashed up the avocado and it still was very good on tortillas and crackers.  thanks
8/26/2011,4,I had high hope but was not a winner for me.
7/24/2011,4,Made it just as the recipe is written with veggies and herbs from my garden.  Delicious!
7/13/2011,4,Ok as is...my changes:  3 avocados cilantro instead of the parsley and oregano 1 jar (either 8 or 16 oz depending on your preferred taste) medium chunky salsa instead of the tomatoes olive oi...
7/11/2011,4,This is a great recipe.  Just a little tweeking.  I used cilantro instead of parsley diced up on jalapeno and added the juice of one lime.  The feta gave it an interesting tang and creaminess. ...
3/23/2011,4,nice fresh and healthy
1/28/2011,4,As other reviewers mentioned this recipe is better with more avocados. Also this recipes make a lot of salsa - for 4 people half of the recipe would probably have been fine.
1/1/2011,4,I made this for a christmas cookie-exchange party.  Everyone loved it!!!  I used three avacados and fresh cilantro. It was a huge hit and I will be making this again and again!!!
9/26/2010,4,We agree leave feta out and substitute black beans and corn
9/23/2010,4,Pretty good.  Always seems like it needs something else.  Still we like it though!
6/5/2010,4,This was pretty good I used canned tomatoes instead and red wine vinegar.  Just difficult to mix starts to turn into guacamole instead of salsa.
5/24/2010,4,This recipe was delicious!  I followed other reviewers advice and used fresh cilantro rather than the other herbs.  I also used feta with garlic and herbs which really enhanced the flavor.  Nex...
5/2/2010,4,I was the only one eating and it was gone almost instantly!  One of the spices (parsley or oregano) was a little strong for me but I don't have the skills to recognize which one so in the futu...
4/27/2010,4,nice dish
2/10/2010,4,Yummy. I used cilantro instead of parsley and used more feta because I love them both. Delicious. Thanks for the recipe.
12/13/2009,4,Gave this 4 stars since I added lime juice and would be better with cilantro instead of parsely like others said. I used real Bulgarian feta too not the cheap kind you buy at grocery stores.  Y...
11/22/2009,4,i added in way way way too much onion b/c i'm still a beginner and thought i could measure it with  my eye. yea no. i put in half a red onion so don't do that! but i give it a 4 because you N...
9/12/2009,4,I used dried spices instead of the fresh stuff but it was still a hit. Very tasty will probably make again.
5/19/2009,4,This was an excellent twist on salsa.  I used 2 avocados instead of one and substituted 2 tsp of lime juice and 1 tsp lemon juice for the lemon juice.  I also substituted cilantro instead of ore...
4/12/2009,4,I tossed the avacado in a little bottled lemon juice before adding the other ingredients and it prevented it from turning brown even hours later.  You do have to let this sit at least 2 hours f...
3/22/2009,4,This was very good.  I doubled it for a party adding extra tomato and some red pepper flakes for a little heat.  I refrigerated for about 5 hours and the avocado was a little mushy. Next time I...
3/15/2009,4,I tried this recipe with several of the recommendations made by others. My biggest concern was the recipe not being able to serve 12 people. So I used 3 avocados 3 tomatoes lemon juice instead...
2/25/2009,4,Pretty good but add more lemon juice because it turns brown pretty fast. I added a mango and it was a perfect contrast.
2/12/2009,4,I make something a lot like this but I just use tomato avocado red onion cilantro feta and lime juice. Maybe cumin if I feel like it. My husband loves this stuff. :)
2/11/2009,4,It is pretty good.  The first time I made everyone raved.  Then I made and took a Super Bowl party and it sat out a little too much.  I don't think it looked too appetizing.
8/12/2008,4,I took this to a lake party and everyone liked it and wanted to know what is in this. Refering to the feta cheese.  Good flavor and a fun new spin on salsa.
8/10/2008,4,This was very good.  I didn't include the feta cheese and I took other reviewers advice and skipped the oregano and parsley and replaced them with cilantro.  It needed plenty of salt and more v...
8/9/2008,4,Doesnt last long in fridge.
7/6/2008,4,Wow this is really tangy!  It's a lot like guacamole with feta and the tomatoes and vinegar give it a lot of zip.  Oh but make sure you don't have any plans for kissing anyone after you eat th...
6/17/2008,4,Delicious! I highly recommend seasoning to taste though. It can be a little bland when you follow the recipe exactly which is why I only gave it 4 stars. All in all great idea and very nice c...
6/5/2008,4,Very good. I omitted the oregano and added cilantro per suggestion. Also added one more avocado and a squeeze of lime juice. It’s like a better version of guacamole and doesn't brown nearly as ...
1/7/2008,4,I made this for a New Year's Eve party.  Guests were all ages and I couldn't have made enough to keep everyone happy.  They LOVED it!
1/3/2008,4,This is definitely yummy -- lots of compliments if only there was a way to make it look more attractive! I had to encourage people to try it which is the only reason I give it 4 stars instead ...
9/6/2007,4,This was a big hit at my party but I put an extra avocado in and I felt it could have used even one or two more in order for the feta to not be overpowering.  Yummy though and different.
9/2/2007,4,Good recipe. The feta cheese tomato and avocade make a good combination. It was a little oily next time I will cut the oil and vinegar in half
5/28/2007,4,I followed directions except I omitted fresh oregano (i just don't like oregano in non-italian dishes).  I did think it needed a little salt and pepper however.  Next time I'll add a little cumi...
2/22/2007,4,This recipe was good.  Although I thought it was missing something.  Maybe some cilantro instead of parsley.
2/19/2007,4,Made this for a baby shower.  I thought it was good - different.  I felt like it was missing something - but couldn't put my finger on it.  I will make it again and play around with the ingredie...
2/10/2007,4,this is a very good recipe.however it tasted like its missing something maybe i should have added some cilanto.
11/12/2006,4,I added some chopped cucumber and baby spinach and put it on a whole wheat wrap for lunch. It was very good. I think the fresh oregano made it a little overpowering though for a wrap...I think n...
9/27/2006,4,I'm not a fan of fresh parsley but I enjoyed this. Husband preferred it with fresh cilantro. Thanks!
9/3/2006,4,Made this for a get together last night.  After letting it sit and tasting it I added salt pepper the juice of a half lime and some cilantro.  Thought it perked up the taste alot.  Thanks for ...
9/15/2013,3,I made this as written with the exception of adding dried oregano instead of fresh.  I think fresh oregano would have made it better.  This style salsa was good to try for a change and had a nic...
4/20/2013,3,Flavor was okay but it was kinda mushy. Also it did not keep well.
9/6/2011,3,I was really hoping to like this recipe based on the others' reviews and because it had the potential to be really unique.  I just wasn't wowed.  It could partly be because my avocados were sli...
9/2/2011,3,I don't know if it was the brand of feta I used or not but this had a odd taste to it we didn't particularly enjoy it.
7/30/2010,3,A little too bland for our taste. We added diced jalepenos and that helped a little. But still I wouldn't make this again. ...not appealing to the eye ....and not enough texture.  I agree with ...
12/18/2009,3,Steve as is - I adding sour cream and it was too mellow - maybe additional cilantro.  Made again 6/15 - semi gross - make guac instead
6/29/2009,3,Must add cilantro 3 jalapeno more avocado tomato and lemon juice! Then its great. Made it first was to bland. Made it again like I said and wow it was gone in an hr! Was yummy
9/18/2008,3,The feta was overpowering. We were not a fan of this.
6/12/2008,3,At first I made it as written with the following exceptions as per other reviews:  1) Used 2 avocados not just 1  2) Used cilantro instead of parsley.  I also used about 4 cloves of garlic tha...
4/18/2006,3,Good and different.  The onions we used were very hot so...  I might make again with less onion.
2/3/2015,2,I'm obviously in the minority here but I don't see how this gets 5 stars.  I thought the taste was very bland.  No spice to it even though I added a jalapeño as some reviewers suggested and I ...
6/14/2010,2,I don't know why really but this didn't thrill me.  I was really wishing I had just made guac.
11/6/2011,1,Did not care for this at all and neither did our guests.  Sorry.
9/4/2011,1,Excellent dish! Quick and easy as well. Made exactly as directed and left party with an empty bowl!
8/13/2011,1,I agree with using cilantro instead of parsley and oregano for sure!  I used cojita cheese instead of the feta YUM! or even just Mexican queso which also has much the same texture as feta.
9/28/2017,5,This is a good starter recipe. We like ours creamer so I added a bit more sauce some sweet relish added additional dill black pepper and mild curry powder. Better than a restaurant! Definit...
9/21/2017,5,Husband is picky but loves this chicken salad and so do I!
9/4/2017,5,This is a fantastic chicken salad recipe! I loved it didn't go over well with the group I made it for but that just means there was more for me that I don't have to share! Great on crackers or...
9/4/2017,5,Excellent. For nights when it's just too hot to cook. I used canned chicken and was yummy. I will definitely make this again.
9/2/2017,5,This is really good.  Picking and choosing from other reviewers I mixed it up early so the flavors could meld but I sprinkled the feta on top instead of stirring it into the salad.  I put the ...
8/13/2017,5,Instead of using tomatoes my hubby and I used romaine lettuce. My picky eaters loved this
8/11/2017,5,This was great!  Made exactly as written and with grilled chicken breasts.  Even the finicky eaters loved it. It's now on the rotation.  Changes for next time might be a little less dill weed a...

6/26/2017,5,So delicious. Only changes I made were using white onion instead of red and I didn't measure the mayo and sour cream just put in relatively equal parts until it was as saucy as I'd like. The d...
5/18/2017,5,Excellent chicken salad recipe.  I used the extra chicken I had after making chicken noodle soup (the whole chicken was boiled in the stock) and it was fabulous.  I was hesitant to use the full ...
3/19/2017,5,I love the combination of the chicken and salty feta cheese.  The chopped pepper (I only had a green pepper on hand and it  worked fine) and onion with a good amount of dill made this very tast...

1/22/2017,5,Very good salad. Super easy and quick to make. I made it to directions except I cut the recipe in half. More than enough for two people.
8/1/2016,5,Very good. I was told by two people that this was the best chicken salad they have ever had! Don't change anything. Perfect the way it is.
7/26/2016,5,Delicious! I used cold grilled chicken substituted plain nonfat Greek yogurt for the sour cream and Smart Balance canola oil mayo for the full mayo. About 5 ounces of that over a bed of mixed ...
5/20/2016,5,This is such a great base recipe for Chicken Salad! I usually use Athenos Tomato Basil Feta. I also usually cut out the sour cream and use more mayo and replace the onion for a dash of onion po...

4/1/2016,5,03-23-16 ~ Oh my goodness this is one of the BEST chicken salad recipes I've ever made. The feta cheese changes the entire taste of the salad. We LOVED this recipe. I made as listed and served ...
8/3/2015,5,Great recipe even without red peppers!! (used green pepper and cucumbers as suggested here). Onions fine for me not in the least too many as also suggested here.
5/31/2015,5,I had nearly all the ingredients for this in my fridge. Was looking for something to use up leftover rotisserie chicken. Made exactly as stated with the exception of using lite sour cream whic...

3/8/2015,5,I added chives and omitted celery and this was a hit! Easy delicious and a great make-ahead for lunches! Love it
2/16/2015,5,I had some left over roast chicken from Wal-Mart deli and Feta that needed to be used. Used the search feature and this came up. My wife and I really loved it. Served with leaf lettuce for an in...
10/21/2014,5,Wow!  I will definitely make this again.  Followed the recipe as written but I never measure anything (I always eyeball)....and as much as I LOVE red onion it tends to be very strong and once...
10/11/2014,5,Excellent.
7/30/2014,5,Delicious salad.  Next time I will substitute plain yogurt for the sour cream.
7/21/2014,5,The sour cream and feta make it less mayonnaise-y than most which we liked. I recommend this recipe.
4/27/2014,5,The only change was the use of fresh dill. This is an absolutely fabulous recipe. A delightful departure from the same old for left over chicken or turkey.
4/7/2014,5,This is pretty darned delicious. My husband loves feta so it's a no brainer. I followed the recipe and it's good.
3/24/2014,5,My first chicken salad ever and this was excellent!! I followed the recipe almost exactly using just a bit less onion as a few people suggested. ONE ADDITION: 1/4 c. of chopped sundried tomato...

6/14/2013,5,THE BEST CHICKEN SALAD EVER
5/16/2013,5,I just used canned chicken and fresh dill from the garden. It was delicious. Feta is a great addition to chicken salad.
4/28/2013,5,I loved this recipe!  So quick and easy.  The only thing I changed was giving it a slightly more Greek flare - added 1/2 tsp dried mint.
4/3/2013,5,Oh my goodness this recipe is SO good.  I omitted the red onion all together and used less of the mayo than called for and added oregano and other italian seasonings instead of dill and the r...
3/31/2013,5,Man is this chicken salad recipe delicious. The only change was out of necessity. I forgot to pick up sour cream and had to use greek yogurt instead. Oh and I bought a cooked rotisserie chicken...

8/30/2012,5,Made this recently and my friend who does not typically like chicken salad thoroughly enjoyed this recipe.
8/1/2012,5,This was awesome! I used what I had on hand and did not have the celery and used roasted peppers in a jar instead. This was so good even with the substitutions!
7/15/2012,5,Made this with vegetarian chicken and it turned out fantastic! I didn't have sour cream so I just used more mayo. I served mine over pasta and made it into a sort of pasta/chicken salad. It wa...
6/2/2012,5,I would just like to throw this out there...amazing recipe! The whole family LOVED this. I cannot remember having like a recipe as much as this in a long time.
5/19/2012,5,wonderful recipe.  left out the celery.  added sun dried tomatoes kalamata olives and chopped peppercinis to give it a Mediterranean flair.  roasted the red peppers in the toaster oven.
5/16/2012,5,A great use for all the stuff I had in my fridge.  I did substitute yogurt for the sour cream.  In my mind at least that and the Mediterranean Herb feta cheese just made it more authentic Mid...

10/16/2011,5,I have made this for years (via a similar recipe). It's fantastic all alone or with crackers or raw veggies. I love the varied textures (creamy crunchy etc) and the flavor layers.
6/17/2011,5,Love this salad.  It is a unique and tasty way to get rid of left over chicken.  It is even better with left over bbq grilled chicken (without bbq sauce of course).  The longer it stays in the f...
6/3/2011,5,Feta was more flavorful immediately after making than next day.  Add feta just before eating.
4/10/2011,5,Very good. Thanks!

3/21/2010,5,awesome with the feta.. love it

6/30/2009,5,I would use a litle less feta but otherwise great!
6/12/2009,5,I love this salad!  It needs no changes just fine as is.  It makes some of the best chicken salad sandwiches I have ever had.  Whenever I make this up it is usually all gone in 2 days and their ...
3/31/2009,5,Delicious! The feta cheese gave a nice taste to thi salad. I didn't have red bell pepper but I had a jar of roasted red pepper so I used some of that just as suggested by GodivaGirl.
3/30/2009,5,Nice versatile recipe. I have also omitted the red pepper and added dried cranberries. They went very well with the Feta. I'll surely keep this as a base to play with.
3/23/2009,5,I made this for a baby shower last weekend and it was a hit! There were no left overs. I followed the recipe as written. I used tomato basil feta and instead of onion I used onion powder. The r...

11/24/2008,5,Delicious! I used only 1 stalk of celery (not a big fan) and about a quarter cup of minced white onion (no red at the time). Love it.
11/24/2008,5,Very good.  It is better if you prepare it a day ahead of time to give the flavors a chance to meld.  I have replaced my recipe with this one.

8/23/2008,5,Excellent recipe...thanks!  The only changes I made were to use 1/2 cup diced red onion instead of 1/2 of an onion...a half of my onion would have been about 1 cup (too much).  I also added 3/4 ...

6/9/2016,4,My first go at Chicken Salad. Made a few tiny substitutions based on what I had on hand (as we all do). Will probably make this version every-other time to keep it interesting.
2/17/2014,4,I took this recipe and changed the servings to 50 for a Bridal shower.  The new measurements called for 2 whole onions and I added 3/4 of one medium onion and it was oniony enough; With that in ...
8/16/2012,4,Delicious Chicken Salad.  Recipe a keeper.  I did not have dillweed but added about 1/4 cup sweet pickle relish.  My daughter loved it.
7/17/2011,4,I used diced cucumber instead of celery and red pepper.  I also used lots of fresh basil and parsley from the garden instead of the dill.  They made tasty sandwiches for lunch.  Both my boyfrien...
1/19/2011,4,Yum!  My husband is in love with this salad!  Next time I will use less onion and more feta.
11/15/2010,4,It's a good recipe for when you want a break from regular chicken salad.  I would probably make this once or twice a year.
6/7/2010,4,Easy to throw together and tastes great! Veggies can be changed out for what you have on hand. I'll only put in 3oz of feta next time - a little too sour for my tastes. Tomorrow's lunch on a tor...
5/21/2010,4,I enjoyed this.  I'm not a huge fan of dill weed so I didn't add very much.  I added extra feta & some sliced almonds for a little crunch.
4/2/2010,4,Super yummy and fast.  Quite pretty too :)  I added two roma tomatoes and some garlic salt.  Kids LOVED it!!  Thanks for the great recipe!
9/14/2009,4,These were pretty good. I added sauted broccoli slaw and onions. I do think it needed a little heat so next time I may add a dash of chili powder or hot sauce
2/21/2009,4,This was a very good chicken salad. I did make a few changes.  I added lemon pepper and a pinch of kosher salt. I didn't have feta so I used blue chees. I also added a 1/4 cup of dried cranberri...

6/25/2008,4,Delicious!  I used nonfat yougurt instead of the sour cream to lower calories and fat.  Adding some toasted almonds and grapes made it easy to do without the bread.  A keeper!
6/5/2008,4,My family loved it! I would cut down on the onions though.
5/31/2008,4,Very good recipe.  I used leftover chicken that had been baked in the oven though.  It was a little dried out.  Next time I will probably boil a whole chicken just for the salad.  I also left o...
5/21/2008,4,Salad was good but I thought the dill was a little too strong.  I'm going to make this salad again but use thyme in place of the dill.  Thanks for the recipe.
3/6/2008,4,Not bad.  I feel like the flavors didn't mesh well even after overnight marinating but it wasn't bad.
2/5/2008,4,Very good but cut back on the red onion!
11/20/2007,4,This took some getting used to but in the end it was delicious in a unique chicken salad sort of way. Now that I think about it I wonder if given the dill pepper and feta if this would be ...
8/30/2006,4,Like most people I altered the recipe a bit.  I used garlic and herb feta (YUM!) and instead of mayo (I can't stand it) I used whipped cream cheese.  It was pretty good and actually I have fou...
8/9/2006,4,Really a good recipe.  I made it for a bridal shower and served on croissants.  I went real easy on the red pepper probably only using about 1/4-1/2 the amount called for.   But I'm not a huge ...
8/8/2006,4,This recipe was tasty. I prepped it ahead of time and took it camping. It kept well and made a hearty and tasty lunch. I used canned chicken which worked just fine but it probably would have b...
8/3/2006,4,Although I would have preferred it without the red bell pepper we both really liked this. I used lite mayo and fat-free sour cream and we had it in wholegrain rolls. Very good. Thanks!

10/17/2005,4,Thank you. Great use for leftover roast chicken feta cheese and red bell pepper in my fridge.  Didn't have sour cream so added a splash of FF 1/2 and 1/2 and a squeeze of lemon. Also substitu...
10/16/2016,3,Odd flavor
7/28/2015,3,I made this per recipe and found it had little flavor. Won't make it again.
4/23/2013,3,too wet for me
8/2/2012,3,Good recipe base! Went the Greek route as suggested & used yogurt instead of sour cream. Topped w/diced peppercinis & cayanne for some kick. Served as a wrap. Next time will add lettuce & maybe ...
10/22/2011,3,Delicious but watch the onions. I thought the red onions were too strong.
4/6/2008,3,This was ok.  I was expecting more flavor from the feta.  Probably wont make again.  Thanks for the recipe.
2/23/2008,3,While okay it's quite heavy in taste. The feta-mayonnaise combo is a little icky.
2/9/2008,3,This was pretty tasty and I liked the feta with the chicken.  But it was a bit oniony.  Perhaps halving the onion would be a good idea.
11/6/2007,3,Hmmm....I thought this was just OK. I wasn't that thrilled with the red pepper in it. (& I only used half) I love feta so I thought I would love this. Oh well!
6/19/2009,2,I don't know what I did wrong but I found the salad to get kind of watery. Maybe it was the mayo I used or something but I didn't really love it.
10/10/2009,1,I don't know but I think we may have messed up the recipe because it wasnt very good at all. Way too creamy. Didn't seem like there was enough chicken.
