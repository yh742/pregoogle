12/17/2004,5,FABULOUS!  I won't be able to make this too often -- I can't stay out it even cold!  I don't think it needs quite as much shredded cheese. I've already forwarded this to several friends.

12/4/2004,5,Very easy to make and tastes so good! I used fat-free cream cheese and fat-free ranch dressing and it was still really good. This is also very good refrigerated with cheese flavored crackers.
12/3/2004,5,Being from BfloNy this is the closest to ck wings. If you substitute 2 boiled ck brst & shred them instead of canned ckn & use a bottle of blue cheese instead of ranch it works even much much...

12/19/2004,5,Fantastic - a new family favorite!  Instead of heating the chicken and pepper sauce first I just threw everything into the slow cooker and stirred ocassionally until well-blended.
12/17/2004,5,FABULOUS!  I won't be able to make this too often -- I can't stay out it even cold!  I don't think it needs quite as much shredded cheese. I've already forwarded this to several friends.

12/4/2004,5,Very easy to make and tastes so good! I used fat-free cream cheese and fat-free ranch dressing and it was still really good. This is also very good refrigerated with cheese flavored crackers.
12/3/2004,5,Being from BfloNy this is the closest to ck wings. If you substitute 2 boiled ck brst & shred them instead of canned ckn & use a bottle of blue cheese instead of ranch it works even much much...

12/14/2008,5,This is delicious!  Due to some other reviews I decided to also leave out the cheddar cheese and now after tasting it I can't imagine it in there.  Doesn't seem like it would go.  I used 3/4 ...
12/11/2008,5,This has quickly become one of my favorites! However like others my variation is a little different. I use a small dip sized crock pot and add 2 blocks of cream cheese. Then I add about a tbsp ...

11/23/2008,5,Love it!  I like either version; blue cheese or ranch.  If you use blue cheese dressing I would add a bit of crumbled blue cheese in place of a bit of the cheddar.

11/16/2008,5,This was sooooo good!!  I used ranch dressing because I wanted to stay true to the recipe but I bet bleu cheese would have been great also. :~)
11/15/2008,5,I made this recipe tonight for a football game and it was delicious. I used Texas Pete's buffalo sauce and served it with Fritos scoops. Everyone loved it. Question -- do you think it would be g...

10/23/2008,5,This is awesome! I make this dip everytime I have a party the only problem I seem to have is trying not to eat it all before the guests arrive! I like to serve it with tortilla chips.
10/23/2008,5,Have been making this for a year and everyone RAVES about it.  I use a store bought rotiserrie chicken to shred cup of hidden valley ranch a cup (not 3/4) of franks red hot and same amount of...

10/21/2008,5,I halved this recipe because I didn't have enough chicken.  I loved it with celery but my 8 and 6 yr old devoured it with crackers.  Hubby was a little disappointed that he didn't get very much...
10/21/2008,5,This was great!  Next time I'm going to try substituting the ranch with bleu cheese and maybe some blue cheese crumbles on top.

It's great hot warm or cold!!"

10/5/2008,5,Excellent dish for a party starter.  I prefer to add all of the cheddar to the mix instead of topping the dish with cheddar.  The cooked cheddar is a little hard to get a cracker into.
10/5/2008,5,I love this but we make it a little different. We put the cream cheese on the bottom of a dish then put the chicken/blue cheese/hot sauce on top of the cream cheese and cover with cheese. Bake i...

8/3/2008,5,I've made this dip for a couple of parties and it's been a hit! I prefer to use celery sticks or plain crackers for dipping; the chicken-flavored crackers are a bit much with this dip.

9/24/2009,5,This is an amazing recipe! I make it every time we have a pot luck at work. It works great to just throw everything in a crock pot on low for a few hours instead of cooking it.
9/24/2009,5,Everybody wants the recipe and no matter how much I make it is not enough. I think the few people having problems with recipe are using cheap or low fat cheese that gets nasty when it melts

9/24/2009,5,Instant hit!!! I made this for a football party and everyone loved it. Instead of chicken crackers I served it with Frito Scoops (celery sticks were not allowed at the party). I also used the ba...

9/16/2009,5,Great Recipe. Will def. make again. Next time I may try bleu cheese dressing

10/23/2010,5,This thing was a crazy hit.  I had to use a full cup of Franks's Red Hot because once the cheeses and ranch were added it wasn't spicy.  And I'm a spice weenie. I took home an empty crock pot....

9/23/2013,5,This is always a huge hit! It's also a fabulously easy supper served over rice. I prefer mozarella to cheddar however.
9/22/2013,5,This was amazing!  Canned chicken at the grocery store was almost $4 a can so I used three cups of cooked diced chicken and it turned out really well.   I used chive and onion cream cheese and ...

9/13/2013,5,Big party hit!
9/12/2013,5,Very good.  I use fresh chicken breast instead of canned and used a little less hot sauce because I'm a wimp.  Usually I'll use half ranch dressing and half bleu cheese dressing.

8/11/2013,5,I absolutely love this classic recipe. I've brought it to several potluck events and it has been a hit every time. It has always been funny to me when a person rates a recipe 4-5 stars and then ...

4/22/2016,5,I made this for a team of 15 picky ppl they all loved it.  Canned chicken breast made this a 5 min dish. Serving it in the cook pot gave it a hot and ready appearance
4/21/2016,5,Everyone loves this dip! I'm always asked to make it. I heat it in the oven until the cheese is bubbly and serve it with tortilla chips. YUM!

2/20/2016,5,Always disappears when I bring it to a party.  I also put it in a 9x13 dish and heat it in the oven on 350 for about 20min (until the sides bubble) rather than keep it in a crock pot.  Delicious!
2/14/2016,5,This recipe is from the Frank's red hot sauce website it is their recipe.
2/14/2016,5,Everybody loves this recipe. They ask for it at many gatherings. It's always a hit. Can sub blue cheese dressing for the ranch but ranch is usually safer as not everyone likes blue cheese.

1/24/2016,5,I take a long baguette and slice it about 1/2 inch thick. Then I brush both sides with butter and lay the out flat on a cookie sheet. I sprinkle them with garlic salt and bake them at 425 until ...
1/24/2016,5,best recipe out there

1/2/2016,5,Delicious!   I used Franks buffalo wing sauce (a skimpy 3/4c). More is a smidge on the too hot side for me.

10/12/2015,5,I have made this several times and it's definitely a WINNER every single time.
10/4/2015,5,This is awesome!!! I use the white meat from a rotisserie chicken and only about 1/4 to 1/3 cup of the buffalo wing sauce. But I'm a total wimp  when it comes to spicy food. This is great served...

7/31/2015,4,Everyone loves it. I've made it to the recipe several times. I've started adding a little bit more hot sauce so it's not too think.
6/16/2015,4,I didn't make any changes and it was great.  Creamy bleu cheese dressing could be used instead of ranch also.
5/24/2015,4,"Great for parties makes a lot and went over well.

I served these with crackers and bread."
2/14/2015,4,I've made this twice for game day now. I just dump everything in the crock pot together and warm it up. It's good! Next time I'm going to put chicken breasts in the crock pot overnight pull it ...
1/30/2015,4,I made this for the first time to take to a party. My recipe called for cooking chicken and I thought I was so clever using canned - I believe in easy! I left this dip in the crock pot because ...
1/16/2015,4,I use 1/2c hot sauce instead. I notice alot of orangish oil that seeps to the top that I have to soak up with paper towels.
1/7/2015,4,Great dip been making it for years. I recommend blue cheese dressing though. I found ranch an odd choice seeing as chicken wings go with blue cheese not ranch. I also use an entire fully cooked ...
12/31/2014,4,The first time I made this with the cheddar cheese I thought it was really salty so I used mozzarella instead and found it to be more to our taste. I also mixed everything at once then baked in ...
12/20/2014,4,Very yummy and extremely easy to make. I did use shredded rotisserie chicken instead of canned chicken.
12/9/2014,4,I really enjoyed this recipe after trying it at a work potluck. However the thought of using canned chicken makes my skin crawl. I used leftover turkey from thanksgiving instead. I also used ho...
12/1/2014,4,This wasn't great for me.  I used Franks Wing sauce and found the recipe very salty.  I did get compliments and recipe requests.  It was also very easy.
11/28/2014,4,Great flavor but too hot/spicy for me and I generally love spicy foods. Next time I will use less hot sauce. Everyone at the party seemed to like it though. Also I bought a large rotisserie c...
11/25/2014,4,My daughter cannot get enough!!!!
10/22/2014,4,I didn't care much for this dip but my family loved it and ate all of it.  I used chicken breasts that I had roasted in the oven.  I also used only half of the cream cheese and substituted wing ...
9/22/2014,4,Used rotisserie chicken but otherwise made it exactly as written.  I love spicy but this was a tad too much for me.  Also tasted a little salty.  I had no problems with the oiliness that other...
8/26/2014,4,It was yummy...
8/24/2014,4,I transferred this to a crockpot from the skillet and added the cheese... It came out very good. Keep it warm... It's not good when it's cold. I wouldn't be opposed to adding some chili powder n...
7/25/2014,4,I would have given the recipe 5 stars but I did have to make one change to make the dip have the zing I was looking for. I had to add a bit more hot sauce than what was stated (I'd guess it to ...
7/5/2014,4,Good dip.  I thought it was a bit strong but my boyfriend loved it.  Served with both tortilla chips and pita chips.
6/29/2014,4,Quick easy and delicious! The 3/4 cup hot sauce gives it a little kick but if you want more of a kick just use a little more hot sauce!
5/15/2014,4,Complete hit with my teen boys-!
5/13/2014,4,We used actual chicken not chicken in a can.  Also instead of using shredded cheddar cheese we shredded a block of cheddar (the flour coating on the shredded cheddar added too much grease to a...
4/6/2014,4,Family loved it but it was a little vinegar(y) for my taste. And others commented on the (fishy)flavor of the canned chicken. Thought I could get around that by using Swanson's brand but it was ...
2/17/2014,4,it was good a little on the salty side but I have high blood pressure and don't really us salt in my diet so my taste buds are super sensitive to anything with salt in it.
2/12/2014,4,This was very good and more filling than just regular dip. I used pulled chicken breast but stuck to the recipe. Served with tortilla chips vegetables and bread. I will make this again.
2/3/2014,4,This was good. I don't do canned chicken so I cooked two breasts and chopped it myself. I mixed it with the franks and 1 cup of the cheese and layered this on top of the cream cheese and dressin...
2/2/2014,4,I made this for our SuperBowl party and it was a huge hit! Everyone loved it with both chips or celery. I added a little more buffalo sauce for some added spice. Overall it was great and I will...
2/2/2014,4,I really liked it but I am trying it again without can chicken the can chicken tasted good and the whole thing tasted great but I am thinking it would be much better with real chicken baked in ...
2/1/2014,4,I used blue cheese dressing and added 2-5oz containers of crumbled blue cheese to the mix. I also diced and sautéed celery in butter and put that in also. I baked for 30 minutes at 350.
1/21/2014,4,Great recipe as is!
1/16/2014,4,I haven't made this particular recipe but I can say that using fresh chicken breast is a MUST I usually fry some up in a pan in a small amount of butter and then cut it up when it's JUST done ...
1/5/2014,4,Very yummy. I only substituted blue cheese dressing for the ranch dressing because I love blue cheese.  Otherwise followed the recipe and it was really great!
1/1/2014,4,I usually try not to rate a recipe if I didn't follow it exactly but I figured I am one of thousands of reviews for this recipe so why not. I took the advice of others and skipped the cheese an...
12/18/2013,4,I have made this recipe many many times and people request this all the time.  I only gave 4 stars because I have changed 2 things when I make this.  I won't use canned chicken (tastes fine but...
11/10/2013,4,Tasty but next time I would cut back on the cream cheese and add more chicken.  BTW I used fresh chicken breast not canned.
11/6/2013,4,Very good dip! I did change out ranch for blue cheese dressing ( I just personally prefer Blue Cheese) My husbands employees ate it right up!
11/4/2013,4,Yummy sometimes I use blue cheese dressing in the dip.
10/19/2013,4,Add more buffalo sauce and more chicken.
10/13/2013,4,I boiled a chicken and used 20 oz of the meat from that. Just pulled the chicken off the bones and cut up with scissors.  I also used my homemade ranch dressing.  I just mixed everything togethe...
9/7/2013,4,Loved this recipe. I will definitely be making this dip a few times this football season
8/16/2013,4,This was good for a quick buffalo chicken fix. Ie did layer instead of mixing all together. Eye appeal is the key. Enjoyed by the family.
8/4/2013,4,This is a nice easy tasty appetizer. It's incredibly easy to make! I followed the recipe exactly except I used a rotisserie chicken instead of canned and added some bleu cheese crumbles on top.
7/6/2013,4,Made with shredded chicken breast instead of canned. Substituted 1 c. shredded mozzarella for cheddar cheese. Warmed and served in a crock pot. Was a hit at cookout. Next time will omit mozzarel...
7/3/2013,4,"Used bleu cheese crumbles instead of ranch and it's
Much Better"
5/21/2013,4,This was amazing with a couple of tweaks. My family devoured it! I layered this by mixing the chicken with pepper sauce. I didn't measure the sauce. I just added some to the chicken until I got ...
5/14/2013,4,Very tasty! I cut down a little on the cheddar and I thought half a batch was still huge. Seems very unhealthy but at least we are dipping veggies in it right?? :)
4/3/2013,4,Very delish! Easy to make and it was a hit! Only 4 stars though because it's good but not the best one I've had.
2/21/2013,4,This was very yummy. I did do a switch and used blue cheese instead of ranch.
2/3/2013,4,I liked it.  I'm trying to eat less processed food so I tweaked it to accomodate that(made chicken and ranch at home.) It took longer but I can feel okay about what's in it. I wish I had cut bac...
2/1/2013,4,I have made this before as is but recently made it again with some changes that apparently sent it into the stratosphere.  Everyone was clamoring for the recipe.  I cooked chicken breasts myself...
2/1/2013,4,Good stuff! I mainly stuck to the recipe and it came out very well. The only alteration that I made was to add about 1/4 cup blue cheese crumbles and I boiled 2 boneless skinless chicken breas...
1/20/2013,4,Tastes great!  An authentic buffalo wing flavor.  Next time I'm going to use reduced fat cream cheese and/or ranch dressing.
1/9/2013,4,A good starter.  I didn't think it was spicy enough - ended up adding more hot sauce.  Also I don't think that melting everything in a skillet is really necessary and it makes for a lot more c...
1/9/2013,4,This was very good and easy. My only complaint (which is personal opinion) is using the canned chicken. It almost gave it that metal taste. Next time I make this I plan to boil chicken shred it...
12/29/2012,4,This is a good concept but an INCREDIBLE dish if you substitute a finely chopped whole rotissorie chicken use only 1 package of 8 oz cream cheese and 1/2 C ranch and 1/2 cup blue cheese dressing.
12/27/2012,4,Decent base recipe.  Changes I make: I cook 1lb chicken breasts in the crock pot the day before with a little water and shred.....canned chicken creeps me out...if in a pinch I buy a rotisserie ...
12/21/2012,4,This was very tasty I took this to a company christmas lunch and there was nothing left.  The only change that I made is that I mixed in crumbled Blue cheese into the dip.
12/14/2012,4,Not too bad.  All I could taste was the buffalo sauce.  Maybe would use less of it next time or try a different brand.
12/14/2012,4,I thought this recipe was ok but I'm giving it 4 stars because everyone loved it!  I triped the recipe to make an entire crockpot full for a party.  I made two changes: I only used 2.5 cups of ...
12/9/2012,4,Just made a few changes but was super yummy!  I omitted the cheddar cheese from the mixture as other reviewers said it was overly greasy but sprinkled a little cheddar cheese on top before ser...
12/1/2012,4,This is a good start. Like previously stated ditch the canned chicken & cook your own. This recipe is Hormel's Basic Buffalo Chicken dip.
11/28/2012,4,I made this for Thanksgiving. My Husband and relatives loved it but I thought it was to spicy. I added more sauce as some suggested so maybe that was the problem. Next time I will follow the rec...
10/14/2012,4,Very good base recipe but I made a few changes. I used rotisserie chicken.  I marinated the chicken with the buffalo sauce in a ziploc overnight (normally I don't have time for this step but ...
10/9/2012,4,Quite a yummy dip. I added a little more Velveeta and hot sauce than the recipe required. One bottle of Goya hot sauce and almost a whole bottle of Frank's Red Hot.
10/1/2012,4,Was a big hit at the pot luck but you need to use regular cream cheese.  Low fat or fat free does not melt nicely.
9/30/2012,4,My coworker makes this for every potluck and the entire office loves it. Everyone is always asking her ahead of time if she's making it and it's the first thing to go when it comes time to eat. ...
9/16/2012,4,"I liked the dip and so did EVERYONE else at my son's football team tailgate party. Trying to keep things easy I decided to do it all in my slow-cooker. 
Turn it on low. Place cream cheese (str..."
9/16/2012,4,Followed exactly except used 3 medium sized chicken breasts. 2 Packs of cream cheese is too much next time I will only use one and reduce the ranch and hot sauce to 1/2 cup as well as add more ...
9/14/2012,4,I make this slightly different. In bottom of baking dish spread cream cheese using whole chix breast (2) shread after cooking and mix with hot sauce and 6 tbls melted butter. Layer over cr. che...
9/7/2012,4,The flavor and creaminess were really good and tasty but this was quite tame spice-wise and that's the only reason 1 star is missing - next time we make it we'll add more Red Hot and a few sh...
2/6/2012,4,I substituted the ranch dressing for caesar. Delicious and easy to make!
9/4/2012,4,this was an excellent and easy receipe.  Next time I will add bleu cheese crumbles.  It was a hit at the birthday party! The crackers were an excellent suggestion and went before the tortilla ch...
9/1/2012,4,I love this recipe except I prefer to boil 2 chicken breast then I shred the chicken.
8/23/2012,4,YUM!! Made for Super Bowl husband loved it and so did everyone else.
8/1/2012,4,Everyone loved this dip. I served it with guacamole pico and tostito scoops it was fun (and delicious) to make mini chicken tacos.
7/10/2012,4,Good but very rich
5/25/2012,4,I got rave reviews on this even from a friend who says she doesn't like cream cheese dips.  I did however more than triple the hot sauce otherwise it was too creamy and did not have a buffalo ...
5/23/2012,4,We really enjoyed this! I'll definitely make it again.
5/21/2012,4,MADE WITH ROTISSERIE CHICKEN. A DECENT DIP
5/5/2012,4,this was really good. I used blue cheese dressing since it traditionally goes with wings. I used 2 shredded chicken breasts. Since my jar of hot sauce had 1 cup in in I just threw the whole thin...
4/10/2012,4,I microwaved chicken tenders and then followed the rest of the recipe. It was an easy hit at the party.
4/7/2012,4,I made this dip a couple of times now. First I followed the recipe as written canned chicken and all.  It was good with a lot of flavor so if you are a beginnger then this is an easy tasty reci...
2/26/2012,4,Excellent I prefer using a purchased rotisserie chicken to canned chicken.  And Franks brand is a must!
2/24/2012,4,As written this is a four star recipe.  It's very good and all of it will get eaten. However if you want a five star recipe use 2 fresh boneless skinless chicken breast instead of the canned....
2/20/2012,4,I made this spicy dip for my superbowl party and it was a hit! I will definitely make it again!
2/18/2012,4,This is a good dip..If my hubby requests it again I shall make it :}
2/15/2012,4,I made this for a work potluck and everyone loved it - though it was too spicy for some. I would probably use less chicken next time and it would be a great way to use up leftover chicken.
2/14/2012,4,Crowd at my birthday party was skeptical at first but as soon as ONE person tried it - gone in 30 minutes! Huge hit.
2/12/2012,4,Yummy I would use chicken I have at home next time!
2/8/2012,4,"This dip was fantastic! I made it for a heavily-male superbowl party and it was devoured.

The reason I gave it 4-stars is because I changed some things as suggested by fellow raters.

I us..."
2/7/2012,4,"NUNPUNCH made this for SUPER BOWL SUNDAY
this is SO TASTY .... almost wanted to put on bread and eat it as a sandwich!!
4****"
2/5/2012,4,Absolutely declicious but instead of canned I use chicken breasts it gives is a better flavor and added an extra 1/4 cup of franks red hot!
2/2/2012,4,I used Perdue short cuts instead of the canned chicken (tastes to canny to me) comes out great everytime...my son-in-law asks for it everytime we have a family gathering.
1/31/2012,4,I make a variation of this recipe that I personally feel is much easier.  Instead of the Ranch I use Blue Cheese dressing and instead of cheddar cheese I use mozzarella.  I combine the chicken ...
1/28/2012,4,I have made this for years and shred my own chicken. I use a good fresh chunky blue cheese dressing.
1/18/2012,4,Yummy but the sauce (Frank's red hot---duh!) was too spicy for me and the kids. Made this for a football party and of course the guys loved it although a couple did mention that it was too spic...
1/16/2012,4,I served this on Christmas eve for my daughter. She loves this appetizer. The only reason it does not get a five-star from me is that I prefer add grill chicken breast rather than canned chicke...
1/15/2012,4,Great tasting & v. easy!
1/15/2012,4,Make this dip often. I love buffalo chicken anything. This dip was good but I would use blue cheese dressing rather than ranch. Delicious!
1/14/2012,4,This recipe is pretty good! I did reduce hot sauce a little as we do not like real hot stuff...I also reduced the cream cheese and added sour cream. I do believe next time I will use buffalo sau...
1/3/2012,4,The flavor was great I wasn't crazy for the texture of shredded canned chicken but thats an easy fix.
1/2/2012,4,Great recipe. I cut the servings in half since it would be just my husband and I eating the dip. I used  a half cup of buffalo chicken sauce instead of pepper sauce.
1/1/2012,4,Quick & people who like spicy stuff seemed to like it.  ;)   It's unusual and a pretty good hit
1/1/2012,4,We liked this a lot. My boyfriend thought it was missing something though....maybe needed more hot sauce or perhaps less cream cheese.
1/1/2012,4,I would give this 5 stars if it used real chicken!  10 oz. is not enough either.  After reading reviews and looking at photos I decided to alter a bit and normally HATE reading reviews when so...
12/31/2011,4,"This was pretty good added extra cheese.
Ended up heating it up in the skillet and served right away. I liked it better with the chicken crackers over the celery"
12/31/2011,4,This is a good base but it was too bland for myself and my family.  I upped the hot sauce quite a bit and added chives and black pepper.  I also used chunky blue cheese instead of ranch tasted ...
12/29/2011,4,Pretty good.  I used rotel instead of pepper sauce.  I liked it very much.
12/21/2011,4,The color makes people tentative to try it.  However it usually takes one person to taste it for the dip to become the hit dish at the party.  I usually follow the recipe exactly.
12/19/2011,4,I thought this was really good. I made it for a party. My husband wanted to eat it all before we went to the party. I found that putting it in the crock pot was a bad idea. The texture was great...
12/3/2011,4,I shredded half of a large chicken breast and 1 can of chunk chicken.  Next time I'll use all fresh chicken instead of canned.
11/21/2011,4,Great recipe.......makes alot
11/19/2011,4,Very very good! And super easy.  I cut the recipe in half and baked it in the oven.  Will definitely make again.
11/1/2011,4,I didn't put nearly 3/4 cup of hot sauce and this was still good and guests loved it. I did seem a little too creamy so maybe next time I cut down the amount of cream cheese.
10/31/2011,4,Not everyone can tolerate this dip but my advice is just keep eating it so you don't feel the fire. :)
10/27/2011,4,Made this for a work potluck. Instead of canned chicken I used 4 chicken breasts (on the smallish size) that I boiled then shredded. I measured out the shredded chicken to make sure and it equa...
10/16/2011,4,"Very tasty
Since it is just me and hubby we had a lot left over so next time i will use two cans of chix but only one cream cheese and a little less cheese/ranch
very easy to make"
10/13/2011,4,Very quick & easy to make. Perfect for football season
10/8/2011,4,The guys really liked this one!

9/30/2011,4,I also use chicken breasts that i cook before and then chop up. Also instead of franks i like using buffalo wild wings spicy garlic sauce!
9/25/2011,4,Great for game day!  Nice & spicey which I love.  Have never tried Frank's Redhot Pepper sauce before.  It's good.  As the highly recommended reviews state I used home cooked chix.  I blended 8...
9/21/2011,4,Love it!  This dip is so quick and easy to make and it's always a hit.  I always use all WHITE meat chicken from the can and buy a national brand not store brand.  You can also use fresh cooked ...
9/21/2011,4,This was okay but not as good as I was hoping. I used boiled chicken and shredded it so maybe next time I will try canned chicken (eek) or use the pre-packaged kind from Perdue.
9/20/2011,4,My friend made this and this was awesome however she cut up the celery and baked it in it yummy....
9/12/2011,4,Perfect for football season! I made this for the Packer kick-off game and guests raved. I highly recommend shredding a rotisserie chicken rather than using canned. Substituted Neufchatel cheese ...
9/2/2011,4,This recipe was just what the doctor order for our weekend cabin snack. I used 2 large boneless chicken breasts 1 cup blue cheese dressing 1 cup frank's hot sauce and 1 8 oz blue cheese and th...
9/1/2011,4,It was good. Alttle to creamy but it was still good
8/21/2011,4,I used wing sauce instead of hot sauce cause i thought it would be to hot other wise and I was wrong stick with the hot sauce.
8/20/2011,4,Add a packet of buffalo hot wing seasoning for a great flavor. Great on tortilla chips.
8/6/2011,4,Really yummy!!! I reduced the recipe by half and used frozen chicken breast that I sauteed (I was horrified by the idea of canned chicken). I also added 3 tbsp of Tuong ot toi viet-nam Chili Gar...
7/11/2011,4,Made it without the chicken was so fast and very very yummy!
6/26/2011,4,This was very good and went over well at our Superbowl party.  I only gave 4 stars because I find it very rich.
6/7/2011,4,I made this for a party that I was hosting.  It was a superb hit!  Everyone loved it. Very easy and well liked.
6/3/2011,4,This is really good I'd probably put a little less hot sauce in there as it overpowered the dip but that depends on the brand of hot sauce used.  Served it with celery and tortilla chips.  Made...
5/30/2011,4,I REALLY liked this...but unfortunately it didnt resonate with my BBQ people. Bummer as I really loved it. Will probably try again...maybe during football season. Did the layering approach....m...
5/7/2011,4,Awesome! Followed the directions except for the crock pot. After melting and mixing I put it in a glass dish and baked for about 10-15 @ 400. Came out beautiful! This was a HUGE hit!!
4/24/2011,4,I LOVE this dip...its like eating a hot wing without the mess. The only exception I made was I only used 1 cream cheese and a little more hot sauce (I like really spicey food). Definately a keep...

3/23/2011,4,Tastes very much like buffalo chicken. I'm not big on the canned chicken though it almost dissolves into the mixture. Next time I'll cook and chop my own chicken breasts instead.
3/8/2011,4,"I personally used fat free cream cheese and light ranch. Still came out good (I had to mix the cream cheese a little harder though so the chunks would smooth out).
I also used two boneless chick..."
2/26/2011,4,My husband really liked this.  I actually used flavored wraps and some lettuce and rolled them up and cut up into bite size pieces and served at our party.  If you like wings you love this dip.
2/21/2011,4,Next time I make it I will be using fresh chicken without a doubt. I dislike canned chicken and you can taste the fact that it is in there. Otherwise its yummy! We used it at our big superbowl ...
2/21/2011,4,Very tasty.  It was a hit at the party.  I shredded my own cheese instead of using a pre-shredded as suggested.  There was still a lot of oil separating very unattractive.  I would suggest not ...
2/15/2011,4,I made this with the same ingredients except low fat cream cheese and low fat cheese didn't think anyone knew it was low fat.  This was so yummy.  My husband started eating it before I got it i...

2/5/2011,4,Really excellent but I prefer it with buffalo wing sauce (such as Frank's) over pepper sauce. It gives it the true buffalo flavor. Love it with tortilla chips or fritos!
2/5/2011,4,i have been making this for years but i use boneless skinless chicken breasts cubed and cooked with blue chesse dressing not ranch. and i always use torita chipsor cornchips with it
2/5/2011,4,This is recipe is really yummy! I did use canned chicken put I will cook my own chicken next time like some other people suggested. I used Texas Pete hot sauce and used more than the recipe call...
2/5/2011,4,I have been making a version of this recipe forever and am always asked for the recipe.  I use 1.5 lbs cooked chicken chopped up (worth it) 1/2 jar of Franks Red Hot Buffalo 1 jar of Marias ...
2/5/2011,4,I have been making a recipe just like this forever. I hate the taste of canned chicken so we usually use the real thing and I usually put pepper jack cheese instead of cheddar. It's awesome.
2/5/2011,4,This is a good recipe-but 'Buffalo Chicken' by definition would use Blue Cheese dressing. I've been making a very similar recipe for a several years now-and I eventually figured out that if I ad...
1/31/2011,4,This recipe makes alot of dip but it was so good it was all gone anyways. I used rotessiere chicken rather than can chicken. Served with tortilla chips and celery. Came out great!!
1/27/2011,4,This dip tastes delicious and is highly addictive. I gave it 4 stars because of my changes. I made my dip with chicken breasts instead of canned chicken. (Canned chicken creeps me out.) I cooked...
1/19/2011,4,I made this for the first time and it was a big hit at the party.  I personally wasn't thrilled with the canned chicken (I had never used it before) and will have to try it again with cooked chi...
1/12/2011,4,With alterations definately 5 stars! Use real chicken and dice in food processor Add 1-2 oz blue cheese Mix cheese in instead of putting on top Bake in oven dish not pan you can stir it and it ...
1/10/2011,4,This is really good. I just think it may need one other thing with it... Just can't put my finger on that yet.
1/9/2011,4,We boiled and then shredded a few chicken breasts instead of using canned chicken.  Also added a pinch of habanero to make it a bit spicier.  Served with Fritos.  Simply put a great appetizer!
1/2/2011,4,Made this yesterday and took Scout99's advice and layered the dip and baked it. I actually didn't like it that way. The cheese on top cooked up hard and the layers didn't mix well. I used diced ...
12/28/2010,4,yummy! I didn't measure anything exactly that didn't use a whole can or package just used the measurements as guides for how much to squeeze or scoop in. (I think I overestimated the chili sauc...
12/28/2010,4,Instead of canned chicked I boiled 3 chicken breast and shred them. I used added crumbled blue cheese & blue cheese dressing. I liked it my hubby was iffy. I think its cause the Franks Hot Sauc...
12/26/2010,4,Good base recipe but I did make some changes to my liking.  Used fresh chicken breasts and blue cheese dressing.  I put everything in the crock pot and heated through on low.  My 7 year old daug...
12/23/2010,4,I would give the recipe as written only 4 stars. I made the following changes. In a bowl I combined 1 cup of Frank's Red Hot Sauce 1 cup of Marie's Blue Cheese Dressing and the 2 pkgs. of cre...
12/21/2010,4,I think this is a very tasty version.  I like Super Blue Cheese dressing and Texas Pete Wing Sauce.
12/15/2010,4,I omitted the chicken entirely and instead of ready-made ranch used a packet of Hidden Valley Ranch with sour cream.  This dip was a HIT!!  I had it warm in a crock pot for the entire evening...
12/5/2010,4,This was good but next time I would definitely use a real chicken breast the canned chicken is pretty much disgusting.
12/2/2010,4,Pretty good.  It was a large recipe.  I took half to a Christmas party in a mini crock and left the other half warming in the oven in a pie plate for hubby. Next time I would only make half for ...
11/1/2010,4,This dip is delicious but has loads of oil on top.  I will leave the cheddar cheese out next time I try it and hopefully that will help and still taste great.
9/26/2010,4,Used a honey-jalapeno flavored rotisserie chicken 3/4 cup ranch and 1/4 cup bleu cheese.  It was tasty and everyone seemed to enjoy it but the color is not very appealing as far as the present...
9/25/2010,4,Made this for a House Party that I hosted.  It was a HUGE hit. I used freshly cooked chicken breast and put it all in the crock for a couple of hours.  I also reduced the amount of cheese.  I ...
9/12/2010,4,my family requests this over and over again!!!!! Definitely a keeper!!!!!
9/12/2010,4,Very good dip.  I will use real (fresh) chicken next time and skip the whole canned chicken thing.
9/6/2010,4,Everyone LOVED this dip! Next time I will use fresh chicken breasts and not the canned. Otherwise it was delicious!
9/5/2010,4,This was delicious but next time I'll double the amount of chicken used.
9/5/2010,4,Made this for a 4th of July BBQ (a little late in reviewing it) & it was a hit!  I served it with corn tortilla chips.  The only thing I noticed was that it was very greasy once it baked so I ma...
8/23/2010,4,I would have rather made this with fresh chicken but the canned chicken made life SO much easier! The recipe makes A LOT of dip so unless you're having a big gathering... I'd say to cut the re...
8/14/2010,4,Very good basic recipe! I doubled and made it for a bacheleurette party the girls ate it all night and there was not a bit left by morning! I did substitute the canned chicken with Sam's Member...
8/1/2010,4,I first tasted this dip at a party and liked it so much i wanted to make it for my own party. I decided to use this recipe because it sounded alot like what the original cook said she did. I wou...
7/29/2010,4,Pretty good! I added a little more ranch and hot sauce. One of the party favorites!!! I served with tortilla chips instead of crackers though.
7/11/2010,4,Great recipe.  I don't use canned chicken... I just parboil two or three breasts or use a rotisserie  from the store.  I also substitute ranch with blue cheese dressing a lot of the time.  But V...
7/7/2010,4,This is the perfect recipe for any night with a couple of friends! I like to up the hot sauce (I use Louisiana Crystal) to a full cup. I just soften the cream cheese in the microwave and mix all...
7/5/2010,4,Good stuff!  I used 3/4 Cajun Chef Louisiana Wing sauce and 1/4 Stubb's Wicked Chicken WingSauce.  Also cut back the cream cheese to one 8 oz package my preference for consistency.  Used bleu c...
6/7/2010,4,Very good!  Big hit when we had friends over.  Served with celery and Sun Chips.  This recipe will come in handy during football season!
6/6/2010,4,4 stars for this recipe as is - 5 stars if you use blue cheese dressing instead of ranch. Add some crumbly blue when it's all done and you'll have the greatest dish.  Thanks Nunpunch!
6/3/2010,4,This recipe is great...I only gave it four stars because canned chicken is not the way to go. I have always made this with boiled and shredded chicken (one pack of three boneless chicken breasts...
5/20/2010,4,Big hit at Super Bowl and a recent Lobster party.
5/3/2010,4,the only thing differently i did was add alot more hot sauce because me and all my friends enjoy a big spice. this was great i made it for my teenage brother's birthday party and all his friends...
4/29/2010,4,I used the can chicken just to be fast.  It was good not great.  Next time I'll use chicken breasts that I've cooked myself and use more of it and I think it'll really hit the spot.
4/26/2010,4,always a crowd pleaser and oh so healthy;-)
4/25/2010,4,I did like many others suggested and used chicken breast rather than canned. Also layered the ingredients and baked in the oven for 25 min at 350. I used Texas Pete wing sauce and only used 3/4 ...
4/24/2010,4,My children and I love this dip. But we eat it with sourdought pretzels.
4/3/2010,4,Good but not fantastic. The dip looked a little pinkish from the hot sauce. Not sure if that is what scared people from it but it didn't get eaten much at the party.
3/20/2010,4,Not that this recipe needs another good review but I'm giving it one anyway. This was very very good. I made it for my daughter's 7th birthday party today and my guests tore it up! I did 1.5 t...
2/16/2010,4,I followed the recipe verbatim and found it to be a bit too hot fo me.  My husband loved it and ate nearly the entire dish himself!  Next time I'll cut down on the hot sauce and save him some...
2/16/2010,4,I felt this recipe tasted a lot like drinking straight Frank's Hot Sauce.  I had this at a party where it was served and then again when I made it for another party.  It is definitely much bette...
2/15/2010,4,This dip was so yummy and creamy when it first hit your tongue but within seconds it was misery!  Maybe the Louisiana Hot Sauce I used it spicier than others (I am also a HUGE spice wimp).  But...
2/9/2010,4,I made this for Super Bowl Sunday and it was a real hit. I served it up with pretzels but when we ran out just started putting it on anything we could find. I used Frank's Red Hot Buffalo Wing ...
2/9/2010,4,This has a nice flavor and would be perfect for large parties...makes a big bowlful...next time I will cut it in half when its just my husband and I watching the Super Bowl! =)
2/8/2010,4,Needs 1/2 cup more of hot sauce but otherwise amazing! Loved it and so did everyone else. Thanks!
2/8/2010,4,Love this recipe w/ a few changes.  I doubled the recipe used cooked chicken breast shredded and layered the cream cheese mixture on the bottom of a 9x13 with the chicken on top drizzled a litt...
2/8/2010,4,Would probably give it 3 1/2 stars only because I changed the recipe considerably and it was excellent. Made this for superbowl last night and it was gobbled up. I used blue cheese dressing and ...
2/7/2010,4,This was really good. I cooked and cubed 2 chicken breasts instead of the canned and used lite bleu cheese dressing instead of the ranch. I heated and whisked this over low heat on the stove. M...
2/7/2010,4,this is incredible although since it is so fattening I used light cheeses and dressings and it was still great
2/6/2010,4,I love chicken wing dip but some of this recipe doesn't sound too good.  It's way better if you use fresh chicken and then shred it....not yucky canned chicken (may be easier though I guess).  ...
2/5/2010,4,soooo good.  I used Bleu Cheese Dressing instead of Ranch.
2/2/2010,4,This was a great recipe but not nearly hot enough.  I added the entire bottle of Frank's Red Hot.
1/26/2010,4,I used blue cheese dressing and neufchatel instead of cream cheese as for the lower fat contents and an kind of chicken shredded (not a fan of canned chicken) - to make it a meal I cook some pas...
1/24/2010,4,a little oily but made some changes and it was DELICIOUS! boiled chicken breasts (2 is good) vs. canned chicken - once boiled just shred with a fork. Much better chicken flavor. We love garlic s...
1/23/2010,4,Made this for game night everyone loved it. Followed recipe exactly. I think next time I will add more hot sauce because it wasn't spicy enough for me. Still so good!
1/15/2010,4,This was good but not great.  I don't get the crock pot thing because unless you've got a smallish one I just can't see this working in something so big.  A fondue pot perhaps.  I just left it ...
1/11/2010,4,A really terrific dip!  I served this as an appetizer on New Year's Day and it was well received.  I think I will try 1/2 cup of hot sauce the next time because it makes it pretty hot for us as ...
1/11/2010,4,i have made this 2 times and making again tonight as i type this.  everyone loves it and keep going back for more.  easy  taste great  what more can you ask for.  a recipe i will use over and ...
1/10/2010,4,I thought it was good but not great.  It seemed like it was missing something.  I used canned chicken and maybe that was the problem.
12/31/2009,4,Really good next time i would use 1/2 of hot sauce and more chicken to make it a little thicker.
12/23/2009,4,made it for a holiday party it was fabulous.  I used frozen chicken breasts that I poached and then shredded
12/20/2009,4,Don't need the cheddar.
12/14/2009,4,This is an crowd-pleasing dip for sure! There is never any left and you will need to be prepared to give out the recipe! I prefer to use blue cheese over ranch the results are the an extra yu...
12/9/2009,4,Very tasty!  This made a LOT of dip but it went very quickly.
12/4/2009,4,This is very good and whenever I make it it's eaten quickly.  I boil chicken breasts instead and shred in my blender.  I just think canned chicken is too much like cat food and can't bring mysel...
11/28/2009,4,This was pretty good however i followed other suggestions and used blue cheese dressing instead of ranch and i thought that the blue cheese taste was pretty overpowering.  Next time i make th...
11/28/2009,4,This recipe was great.  Normally I stick to the recipe the first time making it but I strayed a little with this one.  As suggested I used shredded chicken breast (3) I only used 3/4 cup of ran...
11/18/2009,4,I also took the advice of another member and layered the ingredients with cream cheese/ranch on bottom then a layer with buffalo chicken mixture and went very easy on the shredded cheese. Every...
11/7/2009,4,This recipe was great but a little to creamy cheesy for us. Next time I will use half as much cream cheese and add more wing sauce.
11/3/2009,4,Really tasty and easy recipe. I whipped it together while giving friends directions to our house and had it ready by the time they got here.  I usually stick to the recipe exactly first time aro...
11/1/2009,4,My husband thought it was a five. I thought it was a four. So it's too bad I can't rate four and a half. I didn't use chicken because we didn't have any but it still tasted great on top of baked...
11/1/2009,4,Husband liked it but little at a time...very rich. Next time I'll make it for a party and revisit my rating.
10/26/2009,4,This was really good.  I cut the recipe in half and used slightly more Franks Red Hot and slightly less dressing - and I mixed blue cheese and ranch because that sounded good.  People ate it up ...
10/25/2009,4,I really like this recipe with a few changes.  I use fresh chicken breast that I cook and season with cayenne pepper.  Then I cut it up using my chopper.  I use 1 cup of Frank's and Blue Cheese ...
10/19/2009,4,We really liked this as a snack during football. The bowl was empty too soon!
10/18/2009,4,Like...but I think it needed more chicken or less cream cheese mixture. It was too thin to be my favorite so i had to add a bunch of chicken...But overall had a great taste.
10/18/2009,4,I made this dip for a card party. It was very good and well received. However I think the canned chicken gave it a slightly odd taste.  Next time I will buy a rotisserie chicken and shred it.
10/17/2009,4,It was good.  A little spicy for me but good!
10/1/2009,4,I had read that a few people had separating issues I only got this when I used the bargain brand cheese. I love this recipe. Some use crackers we use golden tortilla chips. The nice thick on...
9/23/2009,4,I gave this recipe 4 stars only because of the canned chicken. Everything about meat in a can does not sit well. :(  I boiled 2 pounds of chicken breast (cut into strips to boil)  I only used 1/...
9/17/2009,4,I made this for poker night and it was a hit. I did not use can chicken. I boiled a few chicken tenders and then shredded it by hand. I used low fat ranch and I don't think it made a difference....
9/17/2009,4,When I make this recipe I cut up about 1/2 cup of celery and add it to the dip. Then you can add more hot sauce and it has a hot and cool taste - just like eating wings! I also recommend using ...
9/17/2009,4,I made a couple changes to this recipe and I think it tastes better my way. I cooked two boneless skinless chicken breasts and chopped them up instead of using canned chicken. Also used 1/2 ra...
8/30/2009,4,Loved this.  I upped the hot sauce a little and it had a lot of zing!  Very popular.
8/14/2009,4,i made this tonight for my husband to snack on while the football game was on (and to do a test run for a possible baby shower dip)... it was good! used a shredded rotissery chicken (canned chic...
7/26/2009,4,This was good! Shredded chicken would be better so I'll try it next time. There are so many ways to make this dip your own. I can't wait to try them all!
7/19/2009,4,I made this using a half franks red hot/half franks red hot buffalo wings (medium) sauce.  Pretty tasty more buffalo-ey.  I will add a bit more chicken next time and may prepare it instead of t...
7/18/2009,4,"This is a winner. It is requested by kids and adults at every party that I have. 

Don't leave it warming in crock pot. The oil will make you not want to eat it."
7/17/2009,4,I also baked it after heating it stovetop as the recipe suggests. I used a large baking dish and took it to a 4th of July neighborhood party and everyone loved it. I'm making it for my brother-...
7/16/2009,4,This was very good! I used it with chicken in a biskit crackers. Delicious!
7/6/2009,4,I made it in layer and used half ranch and half blue cheese. It was a hit!
6/26/2009,4,Great with Celery!
6/3/2009,4,This recipe is delicious but it was hard to keep from getting chunky if guests didn't eat it all right away! Wish I could figure out how to keep that wonderful just finished look the whole time!
5/17/2009,4,Went over great with the family.  I heated and layered the cream cheese mixture in the 9x13 pan.  I mixed the chicken and sauce in a to go container.  Then heated it when I arrived at the party ...
4/19/2009,4,Yummmm. Add extra hot sauces!
4/14/2009,4,I thought was good recipe I made 2 batches. 1 with ranch dressing 1 with blue cheese dressing. Both good. Liked better with celery but good still with crackers.
4/7/2009,4,very good w/ bread or pita chips
4/5/2009,4,I too subbed bleu cheese for ranch and used fresh chicken breasts. This dip turned out DELICIOUS. I made it for Superbowl this year and everyone loved it! I thought the chicken tasted a little w...
4/1/2009,4,it's delicious and great as a party food. i made the dip twice once with can meat and another time with fresh meat fresh meat is better and the can meat taste a little like tuna.
3/8/2009,4,This was a good recipe! Needed a little more chicken but overall not bad. Next time will probably follow other reviewers suggestions to layer ingredients as well as try blue cheese dressing in...
3/5/2009,4,This recipe is great! I used 1.5 lbs of cooked chicken tenders instead of the canned meat. Canned meat just creeps me out! I also used monterey jack cheese along with the cheddar and tobasco to...
3/3/2009,4,This was a good recipe but to be honest the chedder cheese just sounded weird to me so I came up with this alernative recipe.  1 lb chicken cooked and shredded 8oz cream cheese 1/2 cup ranch ...
2/27/2009,4,My husband loved this dip!  However it was not a hit at the party.  I'm not sure if just picky eaters or what.  I thought the dip was pretty good...
2/8/2009,4,Very tasty.  Like a buffalo wing without the mess.
2/5/2009,4,I liked this best with blue cheese dressing and layering with breaded chicken strips (torn in pieces) and covered in buffalo sauce.  Didn't like the chicken crackers....better with veggies or ev...
2/4/2009,4,I liked this dip however I prefer to serve it cold and with tostitos!
2/3/2009,4,LOVE IT!!!!! This is probably the best recipe for buffalo chicken dip. I did change the ranch dressing to chunky blue cheese dressing and I used 1/2 fat cream cheese. I also doubled the recipe f...
2/2/2009,4,We made this last night for the Superbowl. It was a big hit.  The only thing I did differently was to sautee my own chicken to add.  Great flavor especially with the Chicken in a Biscuit crac...
2/2/2009,4,I got RAVE reviews about this dip.  I (like other reviewers) did not use canned chicken I hate canned meat also.  So I boiled chicken and then shredded it by hand before putting everything in a...
2/1/2009,4,I only gave this recipe 4 stars b/c I made SLIGHT variations--this is wildly popular with guests!  I only use 1 pack of the cream cheese I mix white italian cheese (mozzarella or whatever i hav...
1/25/2009,4,DO NOT USE CANNED CHICKEN!!  I did only to give it a fair shot as written -- BIG mistake.  I almost decided to toss it before I even baked it (imagine TUNA w/Frank's Wing Sauce -- eeeyooou!)-- ...
1/23/2009,4,This was good but you definitely don't want to eat too much of it.  REALLY RICH and because of the amount of hot sauce used...LOADED with sodium.  Good for an appetizer at a party
1/23/2009,4,SO EASY !
1/22/2009,4,Very good recipe. I used blue cheese instead of ranch. Great with almost anything you dip in.
1/15/2009,4,I really like this it tasteed better the second day!!!
1/10/2009,4,I used the ranch dressing but instead of putting it in a slow cooker I put 1 cup of cheese in the mix and then transferred it to bake in the oven with another cup of cheese on top for 15 min or...
1/10/2009,4,We all loved the taste of this dip.  However the two times I've made it I left it in the crock pot to keep warm. When doing this the Frank's Red Hot Sauce seperates from the cream cheese mixtu...
1/7/2009,4,This dip is always a hit.  I changed the recipe a bit using 3 chicken breasts sauted w/ salt pepper and basil in olive oil then roughly chopped.  I also cut the cream cheese to 1 1/2 blocks an...
1/7/2009,4,Very good.  I layered it like others recommended and it was a party hit!
1/2/2009,4,This got raves all around. A keeper for sure.
12/26/2008,4,Delicious and you can adjust the heat to your liking. Try fresh cooked chicken instead of canned as the dip turned out a little too salty. Also better served with chips than with the chicken ...
12/24/2008,4,Made this for a Christmas party last Saturday. Very good recipe.  I used 3 small chicken breasts that I poached in water then shredded.  I used blue cheese dressing rather than ranch.  After tas...
12/22/2008,4,This recipe tasted great but I had trouble with it getting oily/greasy on the top after standing the crock pot for more than 15 minutes.  The only changes I made to the recipe were that I used l...

11/21/2008,4,Yummy I make a simmiler recipe (especally for when I am sticking with my low carb diet) But I use blue cheese dip instead of ranch. I also add some mayo. I dont like the chicken in the dip I g...
11/12/2008,4,This was a quick and simple recipe that everyone loved!  The only reason that I rated it at a 4 star is because it was a little to spicy when you add 3/4 cup of hot sauce.  Next time I will be c...
10/28/2008,4,A great and easy dip tastes just like hot wings!
10/23/2008,4,Really good...could use a tip about how to scale down the vinegary taste tho. Definitely making again!
10/22/2008,4,This is good however it's better when fresh chicken breasts are used.  Just boil them for 20 minutes and then shred or stick in the food processor for a few quick seconds.  I also use Blue Che...
10/17/2008,4,it's a pretty good and spicy dip.  i didn't like the twang of the ranch.  next time i'll leave it out.
10/16/2008,4,It was pretty good very well recieved at the office but I was not blown away by it. But I would prefer it hotter and with blue cheese but thats just me.
10/12/2008,4,I do like this dip but boy does it give me a stomachache. I think it's all the fat. I do use reduced fat of any items I can. It is yummy!
10/6/2008,4,taste was good but I could feel my arteries clogging with every bite. Something I will make only once in awhile for gatherings.
9/29/2008,4,Even with a few healthy substitutions this recipe was rich and creamy with a great flavor and nice kick.  Used Fat free cream cheese and only 1/2 cup of reduced fat cheddar cheese.
9/28/2008,4,I thought this was pretty tasty.  Made as is and will probably make again.
9/28/2008,4,I thought this dip was just okay - but a lot of people loved it at the party I went to so I averaged it out and gave it four stars. I'll probably make this again for sure without the ranch dress...
9/17/2008,4,I liked it the men LOVED it. I was pretty spicey and I just used a cup of spicy sauce! I'll make again and reduce the sauce if I decide to eat it!
9/16/2008,4,Have made this twice now.  The first time I made it as written with ranch.  It wasn't the greatest.  The second time I made it with blue cheese dressing.  YUM!
9/11/2008,4,There are so many different recipes for the Buffalo Chicken Dip and I always make one that has blue cheese but I wanted to try this one to see how it would come out. I decided they all taste abo...
8/11/2008,4,This is a great dip for any get together.  I made it exactly as written.
8/3/2008,4,Follow recipe as is.  Very easy to make and very good too.  I served it with pita chips.  Will make again.
8/1/2008,4,This dip is really good.  Tried it for the first time for a backyard BBQ/party and it was a hit....the only dish that was completely gone by the end of the party!  I made it in a slow cooker so ...
7/22/2008,4,I made this exactly as it was written and did not care for it at all.  I think it was the canned chicken that threw me off something about meat in a can freaks me out.  I will try again with R...
7/5/2008,4,I give this a 5 for taste and a 3 for appearance - average of a 4.  This was really good but had a layer of grease on the top.  I have seen others with this same consistency.  Next time I may us...
6/18/2008,4,Added extra hot sauce.  Little different texture
6/18/2008,4,Brought this to a Super Bowl Party and it was very popular.  However I found that the crock pot was not necessary and preferred to add a little more hot sauce.  An extra can of chicken could be...
6/13/2008,4,Everyone really loved this dip.  I will definitely make it again except try substituting real chicken breast for the canned to try and cut down on sodium.  I thought it was a little too salty.
6/1/2008,4,Very good recipe-once I experimented.  i followed the advice of some other members to layer it for a nicer appearance and found it too hot that way.  All you could taste was the hot sauce and he...
5/20/2008,4,Very good but with this amount of hot pepper sauce it may be a bit overpowering.  I agree with the recommendation to layer instead of mixing.
5/16/2008,4,This was good. Not as good as I thought it would be with all the hype :) I topped it with parsley and a few shakes of tabasco for more kick. I did scale it down to 10 servings and maybe some fla...
5/15/2008,4,This is a fantastic dip but I alter the recipe a little bit to fit my taste that's why I've given it 4 stars.  I don't like canned chunk chicken so I cook my own and shred it  I prefer the shr...
4/18/2008,4,This dip is a hit at any kind of sports party! I have gone through a lot of trial and error with this recipe though:  The first time I made it I layered it and baked it in pan.  It cooled off to...
4/12/2008,4,I really liked this dip but I would add more chicken. I did add a lot more cheese and hot sauce to thicken it up and make it hot enough for me which is why it may have needed more chicken. I w...
4/8/2008,4,Very good! My family loved it!
4/5/2008,4,Very good taste - just like hot wings.  Gave it a 4 just because it has a wierd texture and because of the greasy factor with the cheese.  I agree that it doesn't need the cheese.  If I make aga...
3/29/2008,4,This is good little appitizer made them for a party and got alot of comments on it. I like it better with the chicken crackers.
3/21/2008,4,watch how much hot sauce you add.  too much and it will set your mouth on fire!
3/17/2008,4,I debated giving this 5 stars.  It's very very good.  I made it for a large gathering and everyone who tried it really loved it.  I made it exact except I doubled it and didn't add the cheddar ...
2/28/2008,4,We loved this recipe.  It does have quite a bit of grease in it but I suppose that is the chile sauce so it can't be avoided.
2/13/2008,4,This was very good. I did use a roasted chicken from the deli instead of canned. I also wish I had put more chicken in. My husband said it was better the next day and my little boy wanted to eat...
2/5/2008,4,This recipe was great. I made a few changes I used all blue cheese dressing and substituted sour cream for one cream cheese. I also added a little more buffalo sauce then the recipe called for. ...
2/5/2008,4,I did layer this instead of combining the ingridents it made it look much more appealing.  Also I only used 1/2 cup of the shredded cheese on top which made it healthier and cut down on the gre...
2/5/2008,4,This turned out pretty well I was sceptial about trying it since it doesn't look all that yummy but needless to say by the end of the evening it was scraped totally clean!
2/4/2008,4,The bowl was EMPTY before half-time! I used ranch(since a friend told me the blue cheese overpowered the dip). I also used 1 stick of cream cheese and 2 poached chicken breasts and I mixed 1 cu...
2/4/2008,4,A popular choice at our Superbowl party! Everyone preferred eating this with celery but next time I would like to try Frito's scoops. I used all Blue Cheese Dressing. Also used a pound of chi...
2/4/2008,4,I made a few changes - I used blue cheese dressing instead of ranch and topped with blue cheese crumbles.  I also used baked and shredded chicken.  I thought it was a little too creamy with not ...
2/4/2008,4,People loved this dip.  I made it as-stated except I doubled it and used 4 6-oz bags of Tyson pre-cooked chicken breast strips (not canned).  I also used less than a cup of cheddar cheese mixe...
2/4/2008,4,Good recipe but made the following changes as suggested by others: use 3 large chicken breasts (baked then shredded) Franks Wing Sauce half Ranch/half Blue Cheese dressing and only 1 cup of s...
2/3/2008,4,Had it at our super bowl party and the adults loved it! I especially liked it with the chicken biscuit crackers. It was to spicy for the kids but oh well that just means more for the adults! I u...
1/25/2008,4,very very good!
1/23/2008,4,Very good I made it for a party and everyone really enjoyed it! Thanks
1/15/2008,4,Loved the taste of this.  Just like eating chicken wings.  When I make this again I will try the layering method and omit the cheddar (gave the dip some oily spots).
1/9/2008,4,I was disappointed when I first tasted this dish although it grew on me the more I ate it.  It has nice potential but seems like it still needs something.
1/8/2008,4,I made this recipe exactly like the original.  I was expecting to eat this and say Wow!  I'm not sure what all the fuss is about.  My husband did like it but he hasn't asked for it again and ...
1/7/2008,4,Very good used blue cheese because that's my favorite with wings.
1/6/2008,4,We're conflicted. I love bleu cheese my husband HATES it. My husband loves spicy not too spicy for me. I made this last night but cut the recipe in 1/2. I used canned chicken bleu cheese dre...
1/3/2008,4,"I used fresh cooked chicken breast and
shreded when cooled.  I used 1/2 cup of
blue cheese and 1/2 of ranch.  Served 1/2

1/2/2008,4,Made this exactly as written and it turned out fabulous!  I took it to a party for New Years and someone there had made something similar for Christmas.  We didn't find it unappetizing in color...
1/1/2008,4,I am from Buffalo and true Buffalo wings are served with blue cheese dressing NEVER ranch.  For the real deal substitute blue cheese (preferably Marie's in the jar).
1/1/2008,4,After eight hundred reviews I don't know how much more I can add except to say that this is a dish best served with the ingredients layered and in a crock pot so it all stays melty.  Maybe I'll ...
12/31/2007,4,I Love this dip. I did make quite a few changes though. I used blue cheese dressing then I added about 1/3 cup of crubled blue cheese to intesify the blue cheese flavor.  I used boneless skinles...
12/30/2007,4,I made this dish for a house gathering and everyone looked it.  I didn't use the canned chicken (as mentioned by previous reviewers) but 3 chicken breast.  This dip was easy and had a good taste.
12/30/2007,4,The dip was a little thick for my liking.  The first time I had it was at a dinner party and it was a little thinner.  I looked up a recipe on allrecipes and tried this one.  Not sure what alter...
12/30/2007,4,This is a good base for this recipe but I have made a few adjustments.  Instead of canned chicken I Forman grilled Adobo seasoned chicken tenders. Once done I shred up the chicken and add no...
12/30/2007,4,Good overall recipe. I boiled a chicken breast then put it in the food processor.  I did also omit the cheese.It really goes good with celery. I would prefer bleu cheese dressing next time and I...
12/30/2007,4,This recipe was very good.  I bought a rotisserie chicken at the store and shredded that instead of using canned chicken.  Then I used 2 cups of shredded cheddar instead of 1 1/2.  It was a litt...
12/26/2007,4,Great recipe!  I did use blue cheese instead of ranch just my personal preference.  I also boiled and shreded 3 chicken breasts and let it soak overnight in the hot sauce.  I can't wait to serv...
12/19/2007,4,I used the original ingredients as I didn't read all of the reviews. Went and bought a mini crock pot as I thought the warmer the better. It worked great warming it up until we all started eatin...
12/12/2007,4,My mother used to make this when I was a kid and I completely forgot about it until I saw it here. I made it and liked it but I didn't LOVE it. I used half ranch dressing and half blue cheese ...
11/21/2007,4,Very good.  I did as suggested and layered instead of mixed it altogether but then ultimately just ended up mixing it altogether anyway and it's just as good either way IMO.  We're taking this f...
10/27/2007,4,I agree with most everyone else. Use fresh chicken as opposed to canned. I also layer the ingredients then bake it. Cream cheese mixed witht he blue cheese. then the chicken mixed with some hot ...
10/15/2007,4,Very good but an awful color. I used a rotisserie chicken as others suggested (although I really like canned chicken! Don't laugh..It makes a terrific chicken salad) I think next time I will sp...
10/13/2007,4,Very spicy -- I used Blue Cheese dressing to curb the spice.  Great for a football game!
9/19/2007,4,This is a great recipe but I have some alterations that make it WAY BETTER! I use fresh chicken bake it shred it Marinate that in Franks Red hot (with tobasco for those who like it really hot...
9/12/2007,4,The taste was pretty good but I will try it without the cheese using roasted chicken instead of canned.
9/3/2007,4,Always a good dip recipe. Made it countless times and modified countless times. I've used chicken breasts instead of canned chicken less hot sauce less ranch and vice versa. Always turns out g...
8/24/2007,4,This dip is always a hit!  I make mine slightly different though - first I use fat free blue cheese dressing instead of rance and then I just mix everything together and spread it into a baking ...
7/27/2007,4,Tried this today and it was good.Not as good as the crab dip but good
5/23/2007,4,"good recipe except a few people asked is there tuna in here?
not sure why but otherwise really good"
4/9/2007,4,I love everything with buffalo flavoring and this was no exception.  I used fried chicken from the grocery store.  I had to give the recipe out twice at the party we went to.  The appearance was...
4/8/2007,4,This tasted REALLY good... the only reason I give it the four stars is due to the appearance. I know it has been said time and time again in these reviews but the greasy appearance is not appet...
3/31/2007,4,I really enjoyed this recipe but mine came out somewhat oily does any one have ideas what I could have done to cause this or what I might do in the future to aviod it?
3/1/2007,4,I made this for my parent's superbowl party.  Probably wasn't the best choice given the people since they don't really like cheese all that much.  I thought it was pretty good but if you have le...
2/11/2007,4,Good but didn't like the grease floating on the top.
2/5/2007,4,Big hit at party and easy to make. I used. Like other reviewers I used real chicken (boiled 3 breasts for 20 mins then shred) and mixed with franks hot wing sauce. I layered this over the mix...
2/5/2007,4,This was awesome - I got great compliments on it at a Super Bowl Party. A few people requested the recipe. I didn't add the cheese - just seemed over the top.  I also baked it at 250 for a coupl...
2/4/2007,4,My husband absolutely LOVED this. I thought it was really good if a bit heavy (on the other hand it is party food!).  I loved it with celery sticks and my husband loved it with tortillas. We'l...
2/4/2007,4,Wonderful hot not so good cold.  We thought it was a bit salty.
2/2/2007,4,Tried this recipe out in preparation for the Superbowl this weekend.  Used the can chicken stuff as I didn't want to make a breast just to try it out.  Anyway the recipe turned out great.  I us...
2/1/2007,4,great dish! Very creamy even with 50% reduced fat cheese.
1/25/2007,4,This is really good and easy to make. I added about 2 tablespoons extra of the Frank's hot sauce. It was a big hit at our last football party. Make sure you use the type of hot sauce it recomend...
1/23/2007,4,I changed this recipe a little. First I used Kens buffalo suace instead of pepper sauce. Also I boiled 3 chicken breast and then baked them a little and shredded them instead of canned chicken. ...
1/23/2007,4,This is very good.  I put it in my mini crock pot and the longer it sits the better the flavor. I do not like canned chicken but this works great with cut up leftover chicken breasts.  Also I di...
1/6/2007,4,This sounded better than it was.....it was really good but I would even make it spicier.  I might use cooked chicken breast instead of canned chicken next time.  Good recipe!
1/1/2007,4,If you can get past the kind of unappetizing orangish color your in for a treat.  Excellent!  A lot tastier if you add shredded chicken instead of the canned stuff (which I don't care for).
12/30/2006,4,This was good - but next time I won't use canned chicken. Like previous reviewers I thought it tasted like tuna a little bit. Also - it is VERY spicy and gets hotter the longer it sits!
12/26/2006,4,Although I loved the taste of this dip it was the one thing my guest didn't seem to go for maybe because it didn't really look that appetizing. Regardless I will make this dip again. Thanks f...
12/25/2006,4,This is really good! I made it with blue cheese dressing and everyone loved it! The only slight problem I had was that I thought the canned chicken faintly tasted like tunafish. No one else seem...
12/17/2006,4,very good and tangy. Does well hot or cold.
12/15/2006,4,Ugly but tasty.  Loved using celery sticks instead of crackers.  Addictive. UPDATE 9/18/07: I was missing the celery taste if I used crackers so I sprinkled celery seeds (found in the spice rac...
12/10/2006,4,We thought that this recipe was pretty good. It was made exactly as the recipe stated and the only thing that I was not sure about was the cheese. I preferred the dip taste and texture before th...

12/3/2006,4,Very good dip and easy to make. I used fresh chicken breasts that I boiled and shredded. I also modified the hot sauce for our tastes after reading other reviews. I used 1/4 cup instead of 3/4 c...
11/18/2006,4,definatley use real chicken... it is really good though!
11/15/2006,4,Great dip for football season! I used Texas Pete Buffalo Style Chicken Wing Sauce 1/3 less-fat cream cheese (aka Neufchatel) and 1 lb. of fresh chicken that was boiled for 20 minutes (or until...
10/25/2006,4,I've made this for several parties and it's a hit everytime.  It doesn't look the prettiest but tastes great with tortilla chips.  I usually use shredded chicken that is cooked in a crockpot wi...
10/15/2006,4,Got good reviews from friends but a lot of people stayed clear of it becuase of the looks.  I had to explain to people that it was good but the looks were bad!!
10/10/2006,4,Yumm! After I got past the looks of this it really is a huge hit. Served with tortilla chips and celery sticks and put in my dip crock pot. Used two rotisserie chicken breasts. Thanks!
9/18/2006,4,**NOTE** I've posted this review before but had to add this in since I've made this dip many times since then. (by request!) I never add cheese there is no need for it. Also the key to no g...
9/9/2006,4,Made this for a football game this weekend. It was pretty good. I think it needed more hot sauce. We used Franks Red Hot but it just wasnt spicey enough. Also we boiled a chicken breast in some...
9/7/2006,4,Would have gotten 5 stars if recipe called for fresh cooked chicken.  We could definatley taste the can chicken flavor.  Second time I used fresh cooked chicken and was 5 stars!!
8/8/2006,4,This was good but not great.  I think it looks better than it tastes.  I served my dip with Chicken in a Biscuit crackers and tortilla chips and nobody seemed to care for the crackers they onl...
8/7/2006,4,I had my pregnant friend over for lunch and I made this and served it with celery and crackers.  She absolutly loved it.  I thought it was just okay.
7/18/2006,4,It was ok..I was expecting something superb. I followed the recipe to the T. Dont get me wrong it was good but it wasnt GREAT! maybe i need to do a little experimenting with it
6/15/2006,4,It was delicious the first day but the leftovers aren't so good.  Make sure the only make enough to eat the 1st time around.
6/8/2006,4,I doubled the chicken and the hot sauce it was more substancial and my husband likes spicy. I also only used a handful of cheese just enough to give it a thicker consistency. It is a good id...
5/29/2006,4,I have made this recipe before prior to seeing it posted on this website. I use blue cheese instead of ranch (that is the Buffalo way...) Canned chicken works great however so does leftover co...
5/14/2006,4,SPICY but good.
4/29/2006,4,Very easy to make!  I kept the ingredients exactly the same but since I don't have a small crock pot (only a very large one) I just cooked it all together in a sauce pan.  I thought it was ver...
4/12/2006,4,GOOD!!! Try with Sun Chips.
2/26/2006,4,Great recipe!  I made it for a superbowl party but I made it in a crock pot to keep it warm all night. I also boiled two boneless/skinless chicken breast in broth rather than using canned chicke...
2/19/2006,4,This works fine without the chicken too.  It's very good on crackers or chips.
2/8/2006,4,The guys loved this and I liked it but couldn't eat too much of it.  It definitely was a hit though.
2/6/2006,4,I omitted cheddar cheese used 2 boiled chicken breasts and subbed blue cheese dressing.  Unbelievably good got tons of compliments!!
2/4/2006,4,--insert slobbering homer sound here--  Yum!  Decadent!  Easy!  I used freshly cooked chicken - much cheaper and better than canned chicken - and baked it for 30 minutes at 350 in the oven inste...
1/31/2006,4,Very good.  Satisfies that craving for hot spicy chicken wings without the mess.  Like others have recommended I totally omitted the cheddar cheese and substituted bleu cheese dressing for the...
1/26/2006,4,Made this last night for hubby and I as he loves buffalo chicken.  We thought the flavor of this was outstanding.  Perfect amount of hot sauce (I used Franks Red Hot as suggested).  This was my...

1/9/2006,4,Big hit for The Rose Bowl party.  I will cut down on hot pepper sauce next time a little overpowering.  Other than that- Fantastic!
1/7/2006,4,It's good....I think I liked it cold better! Definitely those who love hot and spicy will adore this!  Sure cleared my nasal passages!  I tried it with tuna too which I think tastes better tha...
1/3/2006,4,Great recipe idea - but all of the suggested adjustments by others make it just right.  I used 3 boiled chicken breasts hot sauce per recipe 2 low fat cream cheeses and chunky blue cheese dre...
1/2/2006,4,Excellent.  I used 1/2 cheddar and 1/2 blue cheese as suggested by other readers; however it was still too greasy from the cheddar.  Next time I'll use all blue cheese and just sprinkle some ch...
12/31/2005,4,Made this tonight for the gang. Used half blue cheese and half ranch dressing. Put everything in a pot on the stove and blended well that way then put in a baking dish at 350 for 20 minutes. Al...
12/29/2005,4,Did not use Cheddar Cheese - too greasy.  Also used Bleu instead of Ranch.
11/26/2005,4,I'd give this a 5 except I changed a couple of ingredients to use what I had in the house...I used 1/2 jar of Hooters med sauce in place of the pepper sauce and 2 foil packs of chicken. I made i...
11/4/2005,4,This was very good and very easy to make.  I will definitely make it again.
10/23/2005,4,A real hit witht he guys! I also used Blue Cheese dressing and chicken breast that I cooked and cubed. It was a bit greasy but I think this could be eliminated. Overall great- making it again a...

8/24/2005,4,I LOOOVVVEEE this dip. It has been an absolute HIT every time I make it!! I add more hot sauce as it is a little cool for my families hot taste. Chicken flavored crackers are a little too salty ...

6/17/2005,4,I really loved the taste of this recipe I didn't use a crockpot so it didn't get hot and bubbly so that's why no five stars (my fault).  I used blue cheese instead of ranch dressing becuase we ...
6/6/2005,4,This was an excellent recipe but because of the changes I made I can only give 4 stars.  Instead of canned chicken I shredded a cooked rotisserie chicken from the grocery store. I also eliminate...
3/6/2005,4,This one is a winner! My family loves it!
3/4/2005,4,This was pretty good I omitted the shredded cheese and increased the hot sauce.  Next time I think I will make it as directed to compare as it was a little too spicy for some.
2/24/2005,4,This is now a family favorite. I have had many requests to bring it to family gatherings. Be careful it can be too salty if you add too much hot pepper sauce.
2/24/2005,4,I had this recipe twice before I made it and thought it was great.  When I made it I only made one change which was to use Blue Cheese dressing instead of Ranch - and it made it even better.  ...
2/12/2005,4,This tasted excellent once people tried it.  It has an odd color and texture and so people were reluctant.  However several of the people who did try it asked for the recipe.
2/7/2005,4,I made this recipe for my super bowl party people really seemed to like it.  It was a change to the normal ranch dip for vegetables.  I took other peoples advice and put it the oven instead of ...
2/5/2005,4,Very good.  I will definitely make it again and again.  I boiled a chicken breast in place of canned chicken. Much cheaper.  Thanks for a great recipe!
1/24/2005,4,Served the dip for a football party and it was a huge hit. I took notice to comments regarding the cheddar cheese so I reduced the cheese by half even though most said to leave it out. I must ag...
1/17/2005,4,bill does not like this
1/2/2005,4,Tastes pretty good but not very elegant.  Good to serve for a football game but I'd hesitate for a nice dinner party.
1/2/2005,4,Delicious and easy! I did as another reviewer did and baked mine in a small casserole dish worked great. Tastes like buffalo wings without all the mess!!!!!
12/30/2004,4,I used 1/2 cup of ranch and 1/2 cup of blue cheese dressing and instead of the cheddar cheese I stirred in about 1/2 cup of blue cheese.  I then baked mine in a stoneware pan the dip stayed h...
12/17/2004,4,Yummy scrummy!  I took this to a party tonight and it was a big hit.  I made it with leftover cooked turkey from the freezer and bottled bleu cheese dressing.  I used about half the shredded che...
10/30/2004,4,my husband loved it. I thought it was missing something. but it was okay.
10/24/2004,4,This was great!  It went over really well.  I mixed the cheese in right before serving and gave a stir or two throughout the night and had no separation that some others have had.  Really good!!
8/8/2004,4,This is perfect with a couple additions.  I add extra buffalo wing sauce (Frank's Red Hot) a diced small onion and a 4 oz. can of chopped chiles.  Just the right heat and zesty flavor.  We like...
7/23/2004,4,This dip was a hit! BUT I will say that once it sit awhile it gets really thick.  Even though the good flavor remains the look is not so apetizing.  The second time I made it I added twice the...

6/14/2004,4,This recipe was a toss up since I love Buffalo style anything but not cream cheese.  I went ahead and used 1 cup of Frank's to finish off what was left in the bottle and I added 1 can of blac...

3/15/2004,4,I used fresh chicken with this recipe only half the cream cheese and the full amount of the hot sauce. I didn't bother with the stove top melting process. I simply threw everything (except the ...
2/14/2004,4,It was a bit rich for me but my parents who are on Atkins loved it.
2/2/2004,4,"I took this to a Superbowl party.  In the judging it came in second to a homemade chocolate cake.  ---I can live with that!---

As with every dish I altered this a little bit.  First I used..."
1/28/2004,4,I made this the other day and it was really good. I used Bleu Cheese Dressing and mozzarella cheese. Yummy on Triscuits!!!
2/8/2005,3,This was okay.  Probably won't make it again.  This recipe makes a TON of dip so cut it back if you don't need alot.
2/7/2005,3,This was pretty good however Im not sure if I will make it again. If I do I wont put the chicken in but I liked the dip part on the crackers. Thanks
2/7/2005,3,I made this for a super bowl party.  This was fairly easy to make it got a little messy.  I pre-made this I cooked it in a skillet as directed then before serving heated it in the oven.  I s...

1/23/2005,3,This was not a big hit with my family.  We were expecting the dip to taste like Buffalo Wings but all we could taste was the hot sauce and cheese.  We will stick to the real things next time.  ...
12/13/2004,3,Wow I can't believe the raves on this one. Don't get me wrong it is an ok dip. I just seemed to get a different response than everyone else here mine was It's ok if I never had it again I wo...
11/5/2004,3,I LOVE BUFFALO WINGS SO I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE GREAT BUT I WASNT IMPRESSED..I PROBABLY WILL NOT MAKE THIS AGAIN.
7/5/2004,3,This was pretty good but I actually thought it was too cheesy! Next time I won't use as much cream cheese. Also (after a bad experience with canned chicken) I used 2 chicken breasts that I seas...
6/1/2004,3,I gave this a 3 due to the fact I made this for a Memorial Day party and no one really ate this.  I think because the color? Or possibley they had no clue what was in it.  I will make this agai...
4/10/2004,3,I made this for a party and everyone wanted the recipe and it is even better the next day.
10/16/2017,3,TOO MUCH CREAM CHEESE!! Besides that the recipe is very good! I cooked regular chicken tenders and shredded it myself instead of using canned chicken as well. Following this recipe to a T in my ...
2/9/2017,3,I used blue cheese vs ranch salad dressing. I used Frank's hot sauce as recomended. Everyone loved this dip. Personally I thought it was a bit salty. Wondering how to cut the salty taste?
2/6/2017,3,"I followed the recipe exactly as written. Did anyone else think it was too salty?
Hubby thought  it was extra salty also and he usually adds salt to everything he eats. 
Don't get me wrong it w..."
1/12/2017,3,As written this recipe is not very good rather than give a bad review I made it a different way the 2nd time. First i used rotisserie chicken canned chicken is not good nor ideal for this dip...
6/25/2016,3,This turned out OK.  Not as good as I would've liked it to be.  My guest did say it was good but there was plenty left over and no one asked for the recipe.  I think I will cut the recipe by hal...
3/22/2016,3,I thought it had too much ranch dressing flavor. If I make it again I would cut the amount of ranch in half or maybe substitute blue cheese dressing as many people seem to from the other revie...
3/4/2016,3,It was okay. Will probably make it again but with a different hot sauce.
2/18/2016,3,I would definitely try it again but everyone said it needed more spice. Thank you.
2/7/2016,3,This dip is good with one exception! I prefer Blue Cheese Dressing with my wings.
9/11/2015,3,This recipe jumps to 5 stars when you use fresh shredded chicken breast or left-over roasted chicken (shredded) and also add some quality blue cheese and fresh chopped green onions.  Canned chic...
7/11/2015,3,an appetizer i can make.  yea!  Makes lots
2/17/2015,3,okay. add lots of chicken.
10/2/2014,3,9/28/2014
9/11/2014,3,Good start for a buffalo chicken dip especially if you're one to tweak  recipes to your own tastes. The first time I made it with out any changes my hubby and I couldn't help but feel like some...
12/6/2013,3,I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out good but quite a bit salty.
10/5/2013,3,This was not what anyone expected. of all the appetizers this was the only one left.
8/30/2013,3,If I make this again I will reduce the cream cheese to 1.5 blocks and maybe add more chicken.  It was fine but not my favorite buffalo chicken dip.
6/28/2013,3,'True' Buffalonians know you should use blue cheese NOT ranch dressing!
6/28/2013,3,I make it with Colby Jack cheese chopped up the celery(added into the mixture) and added blue cheese to the recipe...this way it is more like a recipe I received from a former coworker. Much ta...
2/10/2013,3,We liked it bt not as good as he ones at the restuarnts and other ones we've tried at parties.  It was too think
12/27/2012,3,5 star with these changes: I used chicken breasts boiled & then shredded instead of canned chicken I added some butter to chicken in the skillet with the hot sauce. I used 1/2 cup blue cheese d...
12/3/2012,3,This recipe was ok.  I used Nueftel cheese to cut down on the calories but it was so thick I had to add milk to make it dip-able.  I will try it again with the exact ingredients.  Tasted yumm...
9/7/2012,3,A great starting point! I have made this multiple times and it is always hit! However I change mine a decent amount. In my opinion there is too much of the sauce items and not enough chicke...
9/3/2012,3,Nice but just another dip.  I had to add more sauce to even taste it and the cheese was too much. OK.
2/6/2012,3,This was so rich!  I brought it to a super bowl party and it was barely touched.  My husband said you really can only eat about 5 bites before the cream cheese overtakes you.  Not sure how to ma...
2/6/2012,3,It's good as is but I use less cream cheese and more ranch than the recipe calls for because we thought the cream cheese was a little overpowering.
2/3/2012,3,I actually got this recipe off of a walmart TV and we tried it. This is a REALLY RICH DIP!!! I mean almost makes you gag rich. The flavor isn't enough to push past this. The flavor is very mi...
1/29/2012,3,Tasted good but you can't get authentic Buffalo flavor if you use ranch dressing. Authentic buffalo is Blue Cheese and nothing substitutes. Not sure who or where they started using ranch with...
10/30/2011,3,This was way too spicey. I would cut the hot sauce in half.
10/29/2011,3,Made with Tabasco. Think wing sauce or frank's would've made it better. Not.sure if I will make it again.
9/26/2011,3,This was a hit as a game day app.  I used the meat right off of a rotisserie chicken because i couldn't bring myself to serve canned chicken.  I accidentally left out the cheese and it was still...
9/17/2011,3,The flavor of the end product is reminiscent of hot wings but I don't care for the smell that the canned chicken brings.
9/2/2011,3,This was OK - if you use the canned chicken I did not like the flavour.  This is a recipe that you would use for leftover chicken  - or get an already roasted one from the store
3/19/2011,3,Good but not the best buffalo chicken dip that i've tasted.  We enjoyed it though!
2/8/2011,3,This was okay.  I used roasted chicken blue cheese dressing and half buffalo wing sauce and half pepper sauce (Frank's brands).  I served it at our Super Bowl Party and people ate it some com...
2/6/2011,3,This was ok but I didn't care for the texture. It was mushy. Maybe that's because I put the cooked chicken and sauce into the food processor a little too long and the result was mushy meat. Af...
2/5/2011,3,Always a hit... but I prefer fresh chicken to canned. DO NOT USED CANNED - TRUST ME... I take 2-3 Skinless Boneless Chicken Breasts and just poach/boil them in salted water and shred them with a...
1/31/2011,3,Use real chicken. Was not sure if it was the brand of Ranch dressing or the canned chicken but it didn't come out tasting too good.
1/24/2011,3,I gave it a 3 star b/c I'm just not a fan of this dip.  My sister always makes it for occasions and people gobble it up.  I just think it's super greasy.
1/3/2011,3,Made this exactly per the recipe and it was a flop at the party.
12/18/2010,3,It was good but too cream cheesy. Not enough buffalo wing flavor. I would make this again but with only 1 package of cream cheese and maybe try it with blue cheese.
11/8/2010,3,This was much too hot for our taste.  I made it for a family gathering and no one could eat it.  My daughter recommended just drizzling the hot sauce on top.
10/3/2010,3,The flavor of the dip is fantastic but the visual effect of the oils from the cheddar is stomach turning.  I had to sop the oil off with paper towels.  Honestly the cheddar didn't seem to add ...
6/3/2010,3,don't use franks red hot wings-WAY too spicy!
4/27/2010,3,Good but very very salty
3/15/2010,3,Definitely wasn't what I expected....  probably won't make again.
3/7/2010,3,Really not a fan. The flavors seem like this would be great but in execution it's just not that great.
2/25/2010,3,I did not care for this at all. It sounded really delicious and I love all of the ingredients. It was way too tangy. Maybe it was the brand of hot sauce I used.
2/22/2010,3,The dip was very tastey... I gave it 3 stars because it would have tasted better with a real chicken instead of canned chicken!
2/8/2010,3,Certainly not the best buffalo dip I have had.   I followed recipe exactly. Did not have enough Buffalo flavor.   Maybe if you make the changes some reviews suggest then it would be worth more s...
1/5/2010,3,I tried this recipe because it had so many good reviews.  But I am not so sure about it.  At the party  I put it in my mini slow cooker and put it in the corner.  I did not like it at first. F...
12/25/2009,3,To much hot sauce...definitely will not make again. My guest's had 1-2 bites and had to take a drink...never to eat anymore again.
11/7/2009,3,fair greasy spicy
10/24/2009,3,This was way too hot for me.  I couldn't handle it.  Otherwise it'd be great and I will make it again w/ much less of the hot sauce.  Bummer!
10/20/2009,3,Expected more out of this dish from the great reviews. Only ok with modifications it might be better.
10/1/2009,3,I wasn't thrilled with this dip. I think the theory behind it is good but my dip kept seperating on me.  I would add more sour cream and cheese hoping it would cream it up for me..heat it and it...
9/28/2009,3,I really wanted to be impressed. I made it exactly to the instructions with the exception of using blue cheese dressing. While it was eaten by a couple of people there was still a bunch left o...
7/8/2009,3,Not that great.  It tasted okay but it wasn't the fabulously addictive snack that all the reviews said it was.
4/24/2009,3,I took this in for a potluck at work and it didn't go over well. I think it would be better with freshly cooked chicken breats rather than canned chicken. I thought it was ok but I doubt I will ...
2/26/2009,3,This was good but not great. First couple of bites were good but anything more than that was too much.  If i try this again I'd reduce the cream cheese a bit and use blue cheese dressing with bl...
2/22/2009,3,We are snacking on this right now.  This is definitely man food as my teenage son loves it and my husband keeps going back for more too.  I have to say that it does taste like buffalo chicken bu...
12/11/2008,3,I could not make this recipe the way it was called for. I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and only half a cup of blue cheese dressing. Now I enjoy my unhealthy dips and dishes but this was almo...
11/1/2008,3,I cut down on the cheddar cheese and like someone suggested didn't layer it too thick on top.  Texture was great got pretty good reviews at a potluck.  It was just a bit off for me I will ...
10/28/2008,3,Too much hot sauce and not enough chicken.  Next time I will be sure to add more.
6/3/2008,3,I make a very similar dip the differences are: real chicken boil a whole chicken then shredded blue cheese dressing from the jar in the produce section Texas Pete Hot Sauce (2) bottles! It i...
4/15/2008,3,The cheddar cheese makes this extremely oily. I have tried many different combos and have found that Maries Bleu Cheese dressing Franks Buffalo Wing Sauce and mozzarella instead of cheddar is b...
4/2/2008,3,everyone said they liked buffalo chicken better
2/4/2008,3,This was pretty tasty. Easy enough to make. I did end up adding more hot sauce because it was kind of bland for my tastes.  I liked it with the celery but next time I will definitely pass on th...
2/3/2008,3,The canned chicken really ruined the taste of this dip. When I ate around it it was fabulous. Next time I'll skip the chicken and go straight for the good stuff!
2/3/2008,3,Buffalo Chicken Dip is a great tasting dip if made properly.  This particular recipe calls for waaaaay too much ranch dressing.  If you use the full cup it calls for it just overwhelms everythin...
1/29/2008,3,I was looking for a delicious buffalo chicken dip I was served at a party recently.  I found the smell of this dish to be slightly unpleasant. Maybe the canned chicken?  I did try to use half bl...
1/22/2008,3,I used cooked chicken breast and ranch dressing as variations.  I can only give this recipe 3 stars.  It didn't really go.  Perhaps it was the crowd ~ my kids didn't like it and all but one gran...
1/7/2008,3,It was OK.  I am real picky about chicken.  My guests liked it but my advice would be to make it a little more spicy and to not used canned chicken.  I am not a fan of canned chicken.  I think i...
1/2/2008,3,Easy but I think it would be best made with chicken breast.  I found it to be very tuna-ish with the canned chicken.  Way to hot for my taste.
12/31/2007,3,This was just okay for our family.  We love wings and were hoping for something closer to that than just another dip.  I couldn't get Franks so I used Texas Pete's.  It wasn't near hot enough so...
12/30/2007,3,Not as good as I had hoped it would be.  I don't plan on making it again.  It really looks so unappetizing probably part of the reason it wasn't very popular at a party I brought it to.  The ja...
9/12/2007,3,Could use some extra flavor.  Very rich and tasty otherwise!
4/22/2007,3,I normally love everything that's already rated 5 stars by other users but this one wasn't to die for.  Although it was pretty good my friend and I could only eat a few servings before it was ...
3/12/2007,3,I was a little disappointed in this recipe.  I baked regular chicken breasts instead of using canned -- I also added less cheese on the recommendation of others.  It was best with celery -- I th...
2/14/2007,3,Nothing special this recipe was just okay.  This dip looked worse than it tasted.  Because it was strange orange color my children would not try it.  My husband did not comment on it at all.  ...
10/28/2006,3,I was dissapointed with this recipe.  It was ok but from all that I have heard about the dip I was expecting something better.  If I make it again I will try some modifications maybe reducing ...
10/23/2006,3,The taste was great but the color was a very unappealing orange sherbert color. I took this dip to a football party and it got skipped over until my brother raved about it and curious onlookers ...
10/8/2006,3,This is pretty good. I like the others used shredded chicken instead of canned chicken. I halfed the recipe and it still made quite a bit. If I make it again I'll probably change a few things ...
9/18/2006,3,This was O.K. It seemed like it was missing something.
8/17/2006,3,I don't like to give low ratings but I didn't feel like I had a choice with this.  If you like grease you will like this.  I don't know if I did anything wrong (I followed the recipe as writte...
5/27/2006,3,This was ok. I don't know if I will make it again.  I was excited about the recipe since we love anything and everything buffalo but I was pretty disappointed.  The only reason I will make it ag...
5/3/2006,3,"Not exactly what I thought it would be.
Too cheesy I don't know just not the flavor it should be."
2/18/2006,3,This tasted good but had a lot of orange oil floating on it when it got hot in the crockpot. Maybe baking is better? We ended up with a lot left over too bad since it had a good flavor.
12/4/2005,3,Kinda greasy. I did substitute hot wing sauce for the hot sauce next time I won't. Also next time I will shred my own chicken instead of canned. Didn't care for the texture of the canned chick...
9/19/2005,3,I made the recipe as listed leaving out the cheddar cheese as so many had recommended.  It's ok - did not get the rave reviews.  I probably won't make it again.
9/12/2005,3,I was not please with the recipe as is. Guests commented that it was just okay. If I were to make again I would omit shredded cheese (was too greasy) use fresh chicken instead of canned and...

6/24/2005,3,I had never had can chicken before and did not like the taste.  I took myself out of the rating and asked my guest to rate the dip.  They said if I made it again they would eat it but they woul...
6/3/2005,3,I brought this to a party and I couldn't eat it because it was too hot for me - but others liked it.  It was also VERY greasy.  Maybe I should have used less hot sauce.
2/12/2005,3,Not bad.  I'm a big cheese eater and I really think the cheese could've been omitted from this recipe.  I only used one pkg of cream cheese and two cans of the chicken.  definately needed more ...
9/12/2017,2,Am I the only one who finds this way too spicy? I used less pepper sauce (1/2 cup) than called for and still can't eat it. Like the idea but not for me.
2/6/2017,2,Nobody went back for seconds. Epic fail.
12/29/2016,2,I'm not sure I'll make again. If I do I'll change recipe up. Less hot sauce maybe add green onions.
7/8/2016,2,I have been making this dip and trying different variations do not add ranch also using Franks Red hot original seems to be the best hot sauce. don't use the buffalo sauce it leaves a odd aft...
4/17/2016,2,Now this is the way to do Olio! The only thing I changed is using whole cloves of garlic rather than chopped garlic.
1/14/2016,2,Way too much cream cheese. It was so heavy and so thick. We didn't care for it.
7/19/2015,2,appearance was a bit gross and the flavor was soso.  people barely touched it at our party.
1/1/2015,2,So I made this for our New Year's party  did exactly the recipe said but it wasn't a hit no one ate it will not be making it again.
12/22/2014,2,My guests ate this but maybe they were really hungry...I was not very proud of it. I used the canned chicken because although my instincts were to use a rotisserie chicken my grocery store did...
4/2/2014,2,I followed this recipe exactly and when I tried it I was not satisfied. It was really bland. I ended up adding almost a cup more of Franks adding Cajun seasoning garlic more cheese and some L...
2/9/2013,2,I made this dip for the Superbowl.  My husband loves buffalo chicken wings so I thought this would be a good choice.  It was okay when I first made it.  I put it in a crock pot to keep it warm a...
12/3/2012,2,I'll give 2 instead of 1 star after making this only because others liked it. I'll never make THIS recipe again. I don't like my dip chunky and having to spoon out and spooning out with difficul...
9/12/2011,2,i've made buffalo chicken wing dip hundreds of times and I would never make it with canned chicken I did the first time and it wasn't any where near as good as made with cooked chicken breast. ...
8/31/2011,2,Much easier versions of the same recipe that taste the same
5/25/2011,2,Disappointed in this one.  Chicken disappeared (used chicken breasts not canned chicken)
2/9/2011,2,I made this for Super Bowl.  Not sure why because I made it exactly like the recipe but the cheese separated into a pool of orange grease.  It did taste ok but no-one wanted to try since it l...
4/29/2010,2,I wasn't impressed with this at all.For one thing the taste of the hot sauce completely overwhelmed all the other ingredients.Another thing I didn't like was the pool of orange grease that accum...
4/2/2010,2,Ummm no thanks.  This was not awesome.  Only 2 of the people that I served this to liked it.  I used the buffalo chicken recipe from this site & used blue cheese instead of ranch.
3/7/2010,2,I don't know what went wrong here but none of my family liked this... it was way too thick and rich and not very spicy .  It was almost unbareable to eat more than a few bites.
2/13/2010,2,Not a keeper for our family.  Way too thick & way too spicy.
2/12/2010,2,This sounded so good and easy.  I don't think that I did anything wrong we just didn't taste what all the hype was about.  I ended up throwing most of it out. :-(
2/11/2010,2,This recipe came highly recommended but I did not like it at all.  Consistency was too thick and it seemed very rich to me.  Would not make this dip again.
2/9/2010,2,Against my better judgment I made this recipe with the canned chicken as the recipe directs.  The canned chicken makes it so bad.   I'm sure it's good with real chicken but if rating the recip...
11/12/2009,2,It tasted good but came out way too oily. Next time I'll make it in the oven and use a block of cheddar like some others have suggestedd.
10/6/2009,2,Could not get past the can chicken taste. I may try again with fresh cooked chicken.
2/15/2009,2,It could have been the sauce brand I used but this was WAY too salty and vinegary for me to like it. Also it was just kinda like a fat fest of cheap stuff.   Could modify it to be non-canned c...
2/3/2009,2,We did not like this at our house.  That being said maybe this could be palatable with some significant changes.
2/2/2009,2,what did I do wrong?   I followed the directons and it was a mess!I made it for a Superbowl party and was embarrassed to put it out!  Tasted great but the oil from all the cheeses and the dres...
1/2/2009,2,I was so excited about making this recipe as we love hot wings and I thought for sure this would be a definite keeper.  I made this as written and didn't make a test batch before the evening of ...
12/24/2008,2,I was so looking forward to this recipe because we love buffalo wings but this recipe was just disappointing and not what I expected at all. We didn't like anything about it.  It tasted strange...
11/6/2008,2,I made the recipe as written. I'm sure it would be better with rotisserie chicken but I won't bother trying because the overall flavor just wasn't that good. I’m glad I halved the recipe. The l...
10/3/2008,2,I was disappointed with this recipe after all the good reviews.  I made this for a family gathering and ended up with much of it to take home.  I followed the recipe to a T. The cheese left the ...
8/27/2008,2,I really want to love this recipe. I love all these spicy and have a deep and undying love for buffalo wings. I just didn't enjoy this recipe in it's original form or with the suggestions. I mig...
1/14/2008,2,I found the cream cheese and pepper sauce too dominating in this recipe. The other flavors were lost. I didn't think it tasted anything like chicken wings. My only advice if you are planning on...
1/1/2008,2,Ugh!  I usually agree with the overall rating but this recipe was just not right.  I used some of the suggestions from other reviews - blue cheese and  layering - and it just was icky.  I made i...
5/2/2007,2,This recipe was VERY salty I made it again and used Buffalo Wing Sauce instead of Pepper Sauce and it was much better. I also used half the cream cheese and substituted the other half with non-...
1/15/2007,2,Too salty and too oily
1/21/2006,2,This was ok.  I made it for a party and it did not go over very well.  I made the recipe just as directed w/out any additions or substitutions.  I won't make it again....just our preference.
9/3/2005,2,After upgrading recipe with shredded chicken breast Franks Buffalo Chicken sauce and blue cheese dressing still disappointed. Seemed like there was not enough chicken (used 2 large breasts) ...
12/23/2004,2,I took this to a xmas party no one ate it some tried it said it was good didn't have anymore.  I found this dip to be below average very very oily and expensive to make.. not worth my time...
2/22/2004,2,I was disappointed in this recipe.  The buffalo sauce was overpowered and didn't have near enough kick.  I made this for SuperBowl.  Everyone ate some but no one wanted to take the leftovers ho...
9/11/2016,1,Too much cream cheese and ranch and not enough chicken
2/7/2016,1,Followed recipe exactly (only change used rotisserie chicken) but it was too creamy/cheesy and not balanced with enough hot sauce.  This was also was too heavy for the family.
12/29/2013,1,Way too soupy!  All we could taste was cream cheese and ranch dressing with a hint of hot sauce. This recipe needs double the chicken and more hot sauce.  The original Frank's recipe on this sit...
11/27/2012,1,I followed the advice of others and baked my own chicken breasts and shredded the meat. I also subbed blue cheese for the ranch and did not cover with shredded cheese. I brought it to Thanksgivi...
2/21/2012,1,I expected to love this dip because of the high ratings it has gotten but neither my husband nor I liked it at all.  It has a strong Frank's Red Hot pepper sauce taste which just didn't suit u...
3/26/2011,1,I used the can chicken and was not happy! Tasted like tuna buffalo style.
2/21/2011,1,It is very bland and needs to be spiced up.
2/9/2011,1,My family and friends did not care for this. Other than the spice from the pepper sauce this had no other flavor and the texture was not good. Made it for our Super Bowl party and I ended up not...
12/25/2010,1,Use blue cheese dressing. Anyone who knows buffalo style knows you don't use ranch.
7/28/2009,1,I'm sorry but I thought this was the worst thing I have ever made.  It was extremely spicy and the color was a real turn-off.I made a double batch as I had 40 people coming for a party and it ...
6/17/2009,1,What a great recipe. I served it last night @ a jewelry party I hosted and the dip was gone quickly! I would suggest adding another small can of chicken. I used bleu cheese dressing and it was f...
2/3/2009,1,Neither myself nor my husband cared for this dip.  I suppose I could blame part of the reason for this due to the fact that I used canned chicken. It was an ugly orange greasy color.  The blue ...
2/1/2009,1,This dip was great but burned on the way out...smelled pretty bad too!
1/12/2009,1,The first time I made this recipe I threw it out because it tasted terrible. Fast forward one year to a friend's Christmas Party. She made the same dip only instead of using canned chicken she...
10/12/2008,1,I made exactly like the recipe called for and it was simply awful.  After reading the reviews I expected something great.
8/28/2008,1,I did not care for this recipe. I think something went wrong with the hot cream cheese; there was just SO much of it.  This will not be a repeat.
2/18/2008,1,Tasted horrible the first time around with canned chicken so I tried it again with fresh chicken.  It has the potential to be a good dip but I did not like it and barely anyone ate it.  I will n...
2/3/2008,1,I made this for a party yesterday and I brought nearly the whole dish back home. No one enjoyed it even those who love wings. I will say it smelled awesome while it was cooking...that's all ...
1/2/2008,1,Oh lord.  This was so salty I couldn't serve it.  I used some blue cheese and some cheddar (as suggested by one user) and it ended up smelling really unsavory.  Worst recipe EVER.
12/14/2007,1,I had to try this considering all the good reviews. I did not like it very much at all. As it sat in the crock pot it turned into a big dried out ball of goop.Sorry.
12/4/2007,1,I was very excited about making this dip we love buffalo wings and the recipe has gotten rave reviews.  But we did not care for it!  I made it for a party and there were 14 of us who did not li...
10/25/2007,1,USE CHUNKY BLUE CHEESE like Marie's  -  NOT RANCH!!!  You will never have anything that has tasted so good!
9/29/2007,1,I was very disappointed in this recipe after reading the fantastic reviews.  It was very watery.   I used regular cooked chicken breasts like others and I followed this recipe to a tee.  I think...
8/18/2007,1,Sorry but I didn't care for this. I really don't understand the rave reviews which is why I made it in the first place.
8/1/2007,1,I'm sorry but this recipe did not work for me.  I made it for a 4th of July get-together and no one liked it.
2/13/2007,1,Really didn't like this at all.  My husband didn't like it either ended up throwing it away.
1/29/2007,1,THIS WAS NOT VERY GOOD!
2/19/2006,1,Using the canned chicken gave this dip a strange tuna like flavor (yes I'm certain it was canned chicken).  It was left virtually uneaten at a party I took it to.  Sorry :(
11/3/2005,1,Sorry but this tastes nothing like buffalo wings.  The only change i made was to use blue cheese dressing in place of the ranch because my husband prefers it.  Guests kept saying it was okay h...
9/1/2004,1,Looked greasy and unappetizing.  The taste is okay but the texture is all off.  Husband agreed.  Kids wouldn't even look at it ... removing this one from my recipe box.
7/31/2004,1,I don't know what all the fuss was about this.  All 11 of us thought it was bland and not appealing at all. With chicken at $3 a can it was costly. I even added more hot sauce and it still did n...
