12/25/2012,5,This was easy and a big hit! Just made it for our family Christmas dinner yesterday. Thank you!
12/22/2012,5,Followed the 1/2 sugar (white and brown) advice and the reduced (by 1/3) butter advice. A wonderful change and I believe healthier way to make than the marshmallow version. An instant family cla...
12/18/2012,5,I just made this recipe a couple days ago but I cut it in half just to test it out. It was soo easy to make and absolutely delicious! I am already boiling some more sweet potatoes to make the fu...
12/13/2012,5,Sweet topping and a hit at the work party. Delicious to say the least. Just used enough potatoes for the size of the group. kept everything else. Love this and will make it again soon.
12/7/2012,5,This was good!  Made as directed!
12/6/2012,5,Excellent - everyone loves this.  Can't say it's low on calories but to make it on special occasions is SO worth it..and easy!
12/1/2012,5,Made this Thanksgiving day and it was a hit. Don't tell mom but I'm making this at my house instead of candied yams w/ marshmallows. It's not as messy either! I doubled the topping as suggested...
11/28/2012,5,Changed just a few things - I used two 29 oz. cans of yams instead of spending the time making my own. I used 3/4 cup of brown sugar instead of the 1 cup white sugar and I used pecan chips inste...
11/27/2012,5,Classic Thanksgiving
11/25/2012,5,I made this for Thanksgiving this year and it will be added to our future feasts.  The recipe was easy to follow and I didn't change a thing.   I prepared the sweet potatoes the day before and m...
11/23/2012,5,This was excellent! Instead of the 1 cup of white sugar I used 1/2 cup of raw sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar. I used 3/4 tea spoon of vanilla extract.  I also used heavy cream instead of milk...
11/23/2012,5,This was very good!  I did make changes to what others suggested and I did add cinnamon.  What is sweet potato casserole without cinnamon?!?  I got a lot of compliments and even from those who d...
11/22/2012,5,Excellent!  A little on the sweet side so I would likely cut out the sugar in the potatoe mixture next time and just keep the topping sweet.
11/22/2012,5,It was so easy to make and turned out great.  I will make it again.
11/22/2012,5,I made this as the recipe says and it turned out perfect! I ended up boiling about 6 large yams to get the 4.5 cups of mashed yams. The texture was very creamy inside and crumbly on top. This de...
11/22/2012,5,My family loved this recipe for thanksgiving.  I used 1/2 cup fat free half & half in place of the milk and eliminated the sugar from the mash since the streudel on top is already sweet enough....
11/22/2012,5,Very delicious and easy to bake!  Instead of boiling I cooked my sweet potatoes in the oven without foil directly on the rack for about 25 minutes.  Make sure to poke them with a fork.  You can...
11/22/2012,5,My mother insists that I make this every Thanksgiving.  It's amazing.  I don't measure my sweet potato or my milk.  I just add til it looks right.  Recipes have always been just kinda guidelines...
11/22/2012,5,Very good but I added a bit of pumpkin pie spice and some cinnamon to the mashed sweet potatoes.  It just gives it a little more of the traditional holiday flavor that everyone loves.  I think I...
11/21/2012,5,Perfect!  I kept the pecan halves whole which gave us the unexpected benefit of kids actually eating it since it was easy to remove the pecans!  Always a consistent winner in our house.
11/21/2012,5,Wow!  I just made this.  I cut the sugar & butter in half for the portion that was mixed in with the sweet potatoes before the crumble. All the other stuff I followed the recipe.  I made this f...
11/18/2012,5,I made this for Thanksgiving and I got so many compliments for it! I made double the topping and added the teaspoon of vanilla and salt as others suggestions. Really wonderful dish. Much sweeter...

10/8/2012,5,I made this for my family of 8 for our Canadian Thanksgiving today and everyone raved about it. They all had to have the recipe. It is certainly a do it again recipe.

11/25/2011,5,Very yummy casserole I received lots of compliments when I made this for Thanksgiving dinner. Had to add marshmallows for the traditionalist but still the crunchy topping made the dish! Thanks...
11/25/2011,5,I made this for both of my parents and in-laws house...I'm giving it a 4 because it no one commented on how good it was about half of it was eaten at each house.  I probably won't make it again.
11/25/2011,5,This is DELICIOUS!!  Due to previous reviews I only put 1/4 cup of sugar and next time will omit it all together.  Rave reviews at the Thanksgiving table.  This is the new staple for us at the ...

Easy to follow and make. This was better than expected I received nothing but compliments.


Thank you"

11/24/2011,5,I add a small can of crushed pineapple to the sweet potatoes.  Gets raves every year!
11/24/2011,5,I've been making something similar for years. I omit the white sugar all together since I find the dish sweet enough without it. I add a pinch of nutmeg cinnamon and ginger to the mix as well....
11/24/2011,5,I make this every year and it's a favorite dish. I make a vegan version that is just as tasty!
11/23/2011,5,Very good! I've been making this for years. You'll love it. It doesnt take that long to prepare either.

9/20/2011,5,Always gets rave reviews.

9/7/2011,5,FANTASTIC I liked this just the way it was. My husband however opted to make a second casserole and added raisins to it. I don't like raisins but all those that tried both versions loved it.
7/16/2011,5,I read the other reviews and my changes were to only use brown sugar and I cut the butter/sugar combo that mixes in with the potatoes in half
7/8/2011,5,FANSTASTIC! I will never make them with marshmallows again. MMMMM! Everyone loved them.

2/11/2011,5,My husband and I are on a special diet so I didn't add the topping and used Splenda instead of the sugar and it was still delicious.  I used about 1 tablespoon of molasses to give it a brown su...
2/1/2011,5,This is the best sweet casserole I have ever had! A few things I had to change... I ran out of brown sugar... so I just didn't make the topping... and I only used 1/2 cup of pecans and mixed tho...
1/23/2011,5,Amazing.  I baked fresh sweet potatoes and used those.  I halved the amount of sugar and used panela (whole cane sugar) instead.  It gave it a warmer taste.  I made this for a party I had this C...

12/22/2010,5,I made this last night for a Christmas Party at my job and they ate it up!!! It was so good! The only changes I made were to use canned yams (2 large cans) and sweetened condensed milk. Everythi...
12/21/2010,5,Yum!!!  Made the recipe exactly as posted and it was wonderful.  The hubby who thinks the only way to eat sweet potatoes is baked with butter absolutely loved these.  Will make again very soon!
12/21/2010,5,AMAZING!  We have tried a few different recipes for this over the years this is stellar.  Didn't change a thing.  Enjoy!
12/19/2010,5,This could've almost been dessert! Wonderful dish. I made a few changes. I substituted 3/4 cup of pure maple syrup in place of the 1 cup of white sugar. I baked in an 8x8 casserole dish and bake...

12/1/2010,5,HUGE hit!  Everyone loved it!  I would suggest using less sugar next time.  I cooked it in the crockpot on low for 3 hours.  Will be joining our Thanksgiving feast every year.
12/1/2010,5,Delicious!

11/27/2010,5,Stellar recipe!  I made this with 3 14 oz cans of sweet potatoes and made the casserole one day in advance (put in refrigerator).  On Thanksgiving Day merely popped it into the preheated oven....
11/27/2010,5,Perfect.   I roasted five sweet potatoes and that made it really easy to pop right out of their skin.  I made this for Thanksgiving and refrigerated for a day or so until I was ready to bake it....
11/27/2010,5,Awesome first time making and it was a HIT for thanksgiving. It will be done again for Christmas Dinner for sure. The recipe was easy. I even shared it with a Facebook friend.

11/25/2010,5,Great our family loved it.
11/25/2010,5,Really good.  A bit sweet... I think I'd cut the sugar in the sweet potatoes down a bit next time. Also topping needs more butter for the crumble.
11/24/2010,5,We have made these every year for the past five! So much better than the marshmallow recipes!
11/24/2010,5,Good recipe..I used Heavy whipping cream instead of milk (good for creamier texture).  I put cinnamon in the potaoes and I used two cans of sweet pot.  So I reduced the sugar by 1/2 a cup so it...
11/22/2010,5,HOLY SMOKES THIS WAS DELICIOUS!! I followed the recipe exactly and the result was DELICIOUS! We could not stop eating it. After cleaning our plates my boyfriend and I had several extra heaping f...

11/22/2010,5,I've used this recipe for years. I do find a whole stick to be a little bit much butter to put in the casserole so I cut that back by half. I also used the baked potato function on the microwav...
11/22/2010,5,This recipe has been a tradition in our family for as long as I can remember. My Mom makes it every Christmas and now I make it for my holiday gatherings as well. It's my favorite Holiday dish!
11/22/2010,5,This recipe is nearly identical to the one I have been making for about 15 years.  It is the only sweet potato dish I will eat.  My recipe varies slightly in that it uses 32 oz canned-drained ya...
11/22/2010,5,I personally like the fact that spices are left out.  I want to taste the sweet potato.  Leave the spices for the pumpkin pie or add your own preference to the sweet potato casserole.
11/22/2010,5,Where is the cinnamon?
11/21/2010,5,This was served at our early Thanksgiving dinner and it was AMAZING.  Got rave reviews from everyone.  The topping is a nice sweet crunch and better than more traditional marshmallows.  We'll ...

11/14/2010,5,Perfection.  I have made this by following the recipe exactly and it was great.  I have also modified it by using canned sweet potatoes (ran out of time) and it was equally good.
10/30/2010,5,I like the best of both worlds (fun yet sophisticated) so I went ahead and made this recipe w/both marshmallow and sugar crumb topping... it was perfect.  I also followed the advice of many on ...
10/14/2010,5,This is a fabulous recipe.  I have a made a version of it for Thanksgiving for the last few years.  The only difference is using half & half instead of milk.  It has a souffle-like consistency. ...

11/23/2006,5,This was unbelievably good. I made this as a side dish on Thanksgiving and it won rave reviews. Two things: first it makes enough for a crowd so if you have many to feed this is perfect and it w...

11/23/2006,5,YUMMY!  This is the best sweet potato casserole.  Almost everyone went back for seconds.  Doubled the topping since that is what makes this one so tasty.
11/22/2006,5,Very good recipe. Since I was in such a hurry I ended up using canned yams and drained it out then I put some marshmallows on top. If you plan on using canned yams you want to test it out befo...

11/20/2006,5,Great recipe!!
11/20/2006,5,If I could give this 10 stars I would!!  I married into a family that doesn't like sweet potatoes until I made this recipe!  FABULOUS!!!!!!!!!
11/20/2006,5,Absolutely amazing! Every single person at Thanksgiving loved this dish. The caramelized topping was the real winner!!!! I decreased the vinegar to 2tsp. and used frozen cranberries. 10/10!!!!
11/20/2006,5,We love this recipe.  I have shared it with two families and they both asked for the recipe.  We will use this to replace the yams that we usually eat on Thanksgiving.  My husband likes more top...

11/18/2006,5,Brother Mike stay away from this recipe it is mine-all-mine.  As recommended by another rater I sub'd the white sugar out for the brown and this dish exceeded our expectations- YUMMMMMM!!
11/16/2006,5,"it's hard to tell how much sweet potatoes 4 cups is when you peel and boil them.  i used 4 large ones.

11/14/2006,5,Excellent recipe.  Always the first thing to go at Thanksgiving.
11/14/2006,5,It was GREAT!!!!!My family loved it. I thought the recipe was perfect not too sweet at all. I always do the traditional yams with marshmellows for Thanksgiving but this year I will be making th...
11/4/2006,5,Delicious!  A bit on the sweet side next time I'll omit some of the sugar.  But It was tasty and definately got me in the mood for Thanksgiving.  Thank you!

11/3/2006,5,This is a great dessert recipe!  This one's gonna be part of this year's Thanksgiving meal.
10/29/2006,5,I took the advice of other people and added the sugar slowly to the sweet potato mixture tasting each time.  I ended up adding much less than the recipe called for and adding less sugar balanc...

10/10/2006,5,Friends at my Thanksgiving dinner loved it! The Pecans really added the ommppff. I used Yams instead of sweet potatoes worked just as well.
10/10/2006,5,Spectacular.  This was such a great side dish.  Everyone loved the topping.  It just added something extra special.  It was a nice contrast of textures to the creamy potato.

10/5/2006,5,Very good and very sweet.  We liked this very much but it is more like a dessert.
9/25/2006,5,This is truly fantastic I didn't change a thing!  Don't save it just for the holidays I'd eat this anytime.  It went especially well with pork chops since the sweet balanced the salty.
9/24/2006,5,Excellent recipe! I like to serve this with pork chops. I will always make sweet potatoes this way now. Thanks so much for the great recipe! :]
9/23/2006,5,This is one of best sweet potato casseroles that I have ever tasted. I fixed it for thanksgiving and everyone  loved it! Even my son in law who doesn't like sweet potatoes had three helpings.
9/11/2006,5,yummy!  Didn't change a thing. My family loved it. Now I just need to convince my mother-in-law to throw away the marshmallow recipe and use this one!
9/10/2006,5,I just made this for a Sunday evening get together and it was a huge hit!
9/9/2006,5,I quit searching for a Thanksgiving star when I found this recipe.  My only changes are to substitute Grand Marnier for the milk and roast the sweet potatoes in the oven before mashing.
9/7/2006,5,I have made a recipe similar to this one for several years. One of my best recipes. I use real maple syrup instead of white sugar in the mashed sweet potatoes and don't use flour in the topping....
9/4/2006,5,Great.  I froze half the recipe and even enjoyed it four weeks later.  This recipe is a keeper.
9/4/2006,5,I am already looking forward to Thanksgiving this will be the 3rd year I have made this!  It is unreal I love the topping beats marshmellows! My kids won't touch and I won't even make them t...

6/20/2006,5,This recipe is wonderful! It's the only way I can get my kids to eat sweet potatoes. As for the melted and solid butter you can only cut in solid butter so that should help.
4/22/2006,5,Talk about some good stuff!!! This is more like dessert than a side dish. Everyone that tried it REALLY liked it including the sweet potato haters.
4/16/2006,5,Just fixed this for Easter dinner.  I am a major sweet potato fan and this is by far the absolute best I've ever tasted. Next time I'll cut the sugar to 1/2 cup. It will be sweet enough I'm sure...

2/23/2005,5,If I could give this 6 stars I would!  I did cut the sugar in half. It was the talk of our Christmas dinner.  My husband's 97 year old great aunt said they were the best sweet potatoes she's had...
2/23/2005,5,This dish is so delicious that I will be making it all year round- not just at special holidays.  My family absolutely loved it!!  Thanks for sharing it!
2/17/2005,5,Fabulous!!! I had all my in-laws asking for this recipe at Thanksgiving.
1/31/2005,5,My entire family loved it and my mother-in-law begged me to make it for 3 different family gatherings!!!!
1/11/2005,5,This recipe was a hit with all my friends.  Even the ones who don't normally eat or like sweet potatoes. The only thing I changed about it was the fact that I didn't want to take the time to pee...
1/9/2005,5,Outstanding!  Put a layer of marshmallows on before you bake however and it is even better.  (Plus kids are drawn to it.)
1/9/2005,5,"I made this for a big Holiday dinner... several people said they usually did not like sweet potatoes but loved this..

I used Splenda inside of white sugar.."
1/7/2005,5,I'm now required to make this dish for every holiday.  I also added cinnamon and nutmeg to the potatoes before baking which my family enjoyed.
12/29/2004,5,Huge hit at my table. People that dont like sweet potatoes have begged me for the recipe. Thanks for sharing it.
12/28/2004,5,We don't usually serve any type of sweet potatoes for my husband's family.  However I like them so I went ahead & made this recipe.  I got lots of compliments from everyone who tried it includi...
12/27/2004,5,This is easy to make and a huge holiday hit! In fact I made it Christmas morning this year and it took about 20 minutes.   I use half of the white and half of the brown sugar the recipe calls fo...
12/26/2004,5,Fantastic!  I just made this as one of my sides for Christmas dinner and it was a great success!  Try almonds in the recipe instead.
12/24/2004,5,I made this last Christmas and it was a BIG hit!  I also made more traditional candied yams in case no one liked this but there was no need.  Everyone loved this recipe!  I added a bit of nutmeg...
12/4/2004,5,I wish I could give 10 starts to this recipe because it's really worth it. It was such a hit during Thanksgiving Meal that I had people asking me for the recipe. I had to make almost double the ...
12/3/2004,5,WOW!  All I can say is YUM!!!  I made these for Thanksgiving and people who swore they would never eat sweet potatoes were eating seconds and thirds.  My husband wanted to put vanilla ice cream ...
12/1/2004,5,Excellent!  I've made this recipe twice now and all I get is rants and raves about it!  I have a bit of a sweet tooth so I doubled the topping both times.
12/1/2004,5,This was delicious. I tried it a few days before Thanksgiving and even my husband (who will never eat sweet potatoes) asked for me to make again it for Thanksgiving dinner!!!  You need about 5 o...
11/30/2004,5,Let's call this casserole what it is:  DESERT!!!  I would also recommend cutting back on the sugar by 1/4 cup and omitting the vanilla if you want to serve it as a true savory side dish.  Otherw...
11/30/2004,5,I'm not a great cook nor am I big fan of sweet potatoes but I had to make something with sweet potatoes for Thanksgiving.  I made this and was very suprised at what a hit it was.  I even enjoy...

11/27/2004,5,This is the ONLY dish that was completely gone by the end of Thanksgiving lunch.  Everyone but me loved it.  I thought it was good but very very sweet.  But like I said there where no leftov...
11/25/2004,5,I made it again this year. I added 3/4 cups of sugar and didn't do the pecan topping (can't have nuts) and it was perfect! Thanks!
11/25/2004,5,I made this for Thanksgiving and we loved it! I didnt have nuts for the topping but it was still very good.Nice creamy texture.I used 1/2 brown sugar too. We didnt think it was too sweet but ...
11/23/2004,5,This was a big hit at at a Thanksgiving pitch-in.  However I had to microwave the potatoes and it took a little longer than 20 minutes to put everything together.  I also would recommend you co...
11/21/2004,5,Excellent recipe. Next time I would use less sugar.  I used a can of sweet potatoes which make this super easy to make.
11/20/2004,5,If you alter this recipe it's VERY good.  The nuts really add to this dish.  I made it with half the white sugar 2 tablespoons of butter witht the potatoes 1 tablespoon of butter and 2 tables...

1/20/2004,5,I have had this recipe for years and everyone is always impressed with this dish.  The one thing that I think makes a big difference in texture is to use a food processor when mixing the sweet p...
1/11/2004,5,Very sweet. Wonderful side dish. I wouldn't use it as a main dish because it is very rich.
12/27/2003,5,Oh my goodness is all I can say. I made this dish this Christmas for 15 people and I recieved great raves. I was even asked for the recipe. I must say this is one of the best sweet potatoe dishe...
12/11/2003,5,Everyone loved this last year and I'm doubling the recipe for this year.
11/30/2003,5,This Thanksgiving was my first time making sweet potatoes of any kind and to be honest I was not crazy about sweet potatoes in the past.  This recipe made me a sweet potato lover.  This recipe i...
11/28/2003,5,I got rave reviews when making this dish for picky family members at Thanksgiving.  I did make some substitutions though:  I used heavy cream in place of the milk and I added a teaspoon each o...
11/28/2003,5,Amazing!  I reduced the milk just a smidge and added a shot of bourbon.  Unbelievable!!  I will definately make this a holiday staple!!
11/22/2003,5,This recipe is so easy and a time saver. I received great reviews when I took this dish to a office dinner. Thanks I'll defenitely use again and again!!
11/19/2003,5,This recipe is so delicious!!  I replaced some of the sugar in the sweet potoato mixture with maple syrup which really adds to the taste.
10/12/2003,5,This was a big hit at my house.  I used walnuts instead of pecans.  Still tasted delicious!!!
10/6/2003,5,This is awesome I cut the sugar back a little too really good the next day with leftovers too!!!
8/22/2003,5,Mmmmm!  And it makes the kitchen smell so good too.  This recipe says 16 servings and that's true but it won't feed 16 people because everyone will want seconds and thirds of this tasty treat...
8/17/2003,5,This is our new holiday favorite.
1/1/2003,5,The rave at inlaws for Christmas...will make again.
12/27/2002,5,Thanks for sharing this recipe - it was so delicious!
12/16/2002,5,This recipe is delicious.  Has been served at my family Thanksgiving dinner for over 30 years!  Everything old is new again!
12/15/2002,5,You could make it for dessert :)
12/14/2002,5,This is great but I used 1/3 cup flour 1/3 cup brown sugar 1/3 cupchopped pecans 1/3 cup coconut & 1/2 cup melted butter for topping.
12/10/2002,5,I made this for Thanksgiving dinner & everyone loved it!!!
12/5/2002,5,When I made this for Thanksgiving I halved the recipe because people here don't usually enjoy sweet potatoes but everyone loved these.  They were gone within a couple of days.
12/4/2002,5,This is the best sweet potato casserole that I've ever tasted. It is a definate must for Thanksgiving.
12/4/2002,5,I made this recipe for Thanksgiving.  I think it would have been excellent if I would have followed the directions.  I used canned yams instead of cooked sweet potatoes.  I thought this would sa...

12/1/2002,5,Lovely recipe.  Very good flavor and just the right amount of streusel topping.
11/29/2002,5,I tried this dish on yesterday for my Thanksgiving feast and it was absolutely wonderful and very tasteful. But I did add 1/2 of teaspoon of cinnamon and nutmeg because sweet potatoes just doesn...
11/24/2002,5,We just celebrated Thanksgiving yesterday and I last minute tried this recipe. Wow! It was a hit. The pecan topping is wonderful. Being a diabetic I had a taste and I was in heaven. I made this...
11/4/2002,5,Very easy and delicious!  I'm going to make it for Thanksgiving this year.  I may try reducing the butter and sugar just a bit.

12/30/2001,5,this recipe is excellent!!!  it's so good that my mother-in-law has asked me to bring it for every family gathering since Thanksgiving!!!  I did reduce the white sugar to 1/3 cup and everyone (...
12/28/2001,5,I found this recipe very easy to make and surprisingly good.  I choose to make this recipe based on the ingredients listed. Dona
12/10/2001,5,This was so yummy everyone asked for the recipe. For the topping I used walnuts instead of pecans and covered it with foil for part of the cooking time so that the topping didn't get burned. D...
12/10/2001,5,This is a miracle worker! I've never liked sweet potatoes (nor has my father). Made these and LOVED them they are so rich and the topping is heavenly. No more canned potatoes for this group. Ca...
5/9/2001,5,I cut down on the butter and sugar in this recipe and my husband still loved it!
12/20/2000,5,I found this recipe looking to break the traditional marshmallow/sweet potato combo. I pulled this off Thanksgiving.com and WOW it was a huge hit. My husband's family couldn't get enough! My si...
12/17/2000,5,Thanksgiving-2000---Very good
12/14/2000,5,We had  this at our Thanksgiving gahtering of 25 people  Everyone went back for 2nds & 3rds and begged for the recipe and any lefftoversrs to take home. yummy.  Even some of our finicky childre...
10/26/2000,5,This sounds great.
11/27/2017,4,Followed the recipe. It was really good. In my opinion I think you can cut back on the sugar in the topping.
11/24/2017,4,Very good a little too sweet I will cut the white sugar by half next time.
12/30/2016,4,It was delicious! I added marshmallow cream as well under the crumbly topping
11/28/2016,4,Very good but too sweet even after cutting sugar by 1/4 cup. I'll cut in half next time
11/24/2016,4,Good recipe though I'm not sure why it doesn't have some spices added to it. I added ground dry spices in the following proportions: 2 tsp cinnamon 1/2 tsp ginger 1/2 tsp clove and 1/4 tsp n...
6/5/2016,4,Really impressed with this but will do a quarter cup less sugar in the potato mixture next time. Used sugar in the raw instead of white sugar.
10/10/2015,4,I love this recipe I find it a bit sweet though so I usually half the amount of white sugar. I usually make it as is but for a nice change I substitute half of the milk for bourbon and add a bi...
1/12/2015,4,Yummy!  I tried this recipe for thanksgiving dinner my mother in-law freaked out at first because it wasn't traditional  sweet potatoes.  This last year it was requested because it was such a h...
12/3/2014,4,This was delicious! Didn't use as much sugar as the recipe called for so I am rating it 4 instead of 5 stars. Thank you!
11/30/2014,4,We've made this for Thanksgiving 2 years running while living abroad in Spain. It's a huge hit though sometimes we have to substitute walnuts because we can't find pecans. So so good even reh...
11/27/2014,4,I added less sugar. About 3/4 cup. Added cinnamon. For the topping didn't use flour or butter. Just sprinkled chopped pecans and a little bit of brown sugar. The sweet potatoes have their own sw...
11/2/2014,4,Beware of making this dish in too deep of a pan.  The first time I made it I doubled it and the middle didn't set up.  Needs a shallow baking dish for success.
6/20/2014,4,Very tasty! My husband always says he hates sweet potatoes and he had seconds. Next time I will definitely double the topping it was so good!
5/13/2014,4,Simple to make and tastes delicious!
12/25/2013,4,Decrease sugar
11/28/2013,4,I thought this looked good but sugar content was off the chart!  I cut the white sugar in half and added 1/4c of stevia to the mash.  I then cut the ingredients for the streusel topping in half...
11/21/2013,4,Tasty and easy. Used canned yams and evaporated milk and no sugar IN the potatoes. May add suggested spices next time. Will use three large cans of yams but the same amount of topping as I thoug...
11/27/2012,4,When I made this recipe the first time I thought it was too sweet. The second time I made it I only used 1/2 cup of white sugar. It turned out great then!!
11/27/2012,4,Made 1/2 recipe with full recipe of topping and used canned sweet potatoes.  Too sweet.
11/23/2012,4,This is a four star recipe. With the changes I made based off other people's reviews it's definitely a five star. The dish was scraped clean. I used 6 baked sweet potatoes (wrap in foil 400 de...
11/6/2012,4,This recipe is very nice but very sweet and I even cut back on the white sugar by a 1/4 of a cup.  Seems like a very good Thanksgiving dish.  Next time I may cut back on some of the brown sugar...
4/9/2012,4,Very tasty. While others at the table would have given it five stars I thought it was too sweet and would try and cut down on the sugar next time.
1/12/2012,4,I'm going to rate this a 4 although I haven't tried it I use have used one very similar for years and love it. The difference in the one I use is that the receipe calls for 3 cups of potatoes ...
1/5/2012,4,The perfect dessert!
12/20/2011,4,Was fantastic decreased sugar but was still too sweet. Will forever be on my Thanksgiving food list!
9/17/2011,4,Very sweet-- id rate 8 out of a 10
5/8/2011,4,I cut sugar by half and this still tasted great.
2/23/2011,4,Kid-approved!
1/20/2011,4,This was so sweet and tasty. My husband is begging me to make more!
1/8/2011,4,A little sweet.
12/30/2010,4,I love this recipe.....if you do not want as sweet I would cut the sugar at least in half.
12/25/2010,4,These were easy and great!
12/14/2010,4,I made this for Thanksgiving at my daughter's request. She loved it of course. I thought it was a bit too sweet for a side dish - even though I could not stop eating it. It is like candy.
12/7/2010,4,This was my first experience making or eating a sweet potato casserole and while it was really good next time I will make some changes.  For my taste this recipe was both a touch too sweet and ...
12/1/2010,4,This was really good.  I wasn't blown away by the flavor and thought it could use a little more something but overall it was very good.  The topping was fabulous.  I will make this again thank...
12/1/2010,4,good stuff
11/30/2010,4,I used the evaporated milk as was suggested I used canned sweet potatoes 1 tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp of cinnamon- these were delicious!!
11/26/2010,4,This recipe was a big hit at Thanksgiving. Sweet potatoes and yams are naturally pretty sweet so I omitted the 1 cup of white sugar. I recommend tasting the potato mixture before adding any add...
11/26/2010,4,Very good easy recipe!
11/25/2010,4,Great recipe but waaaaay too sweet for my family's taste buds. I made it with a third a cup of brown sugar in the topping and nothing but the eggs vanilla and some Smart Balance in the potato...
11/25/2010,4,The sweet potato part is really really good. The topping however was MUCH too sweet. It was an overwhelming amount of sugar for the amount of potato. I would cut it by a 1/4 next time or skip...
11/25/2010,4,It was good probably too sugary. I accidentally made the topping too mushy instead of crumbly so it was basically impossible to spread on top I ended up having to just mix it in to the potatoe...
11/24/2010,4,This is really good!  But a whole cup of white sugar is a really unwise choice for so many of us.  I used 3/4 cup pure maple syrup instead and it came out wonderful!
4/25/2010,4,My dad and husband REALLY liked this!
12/26/2009,4,Yum!!  Although we loved this casserole dish I have to rate it a 4 because we all thought that it was to sweet.  I will definitley make it again but with about 1/2 the recomended amount of white...
10/11/2009,4,My family really liked it. I used fresh cooked sweet potatoes and it came out good.
10/3/2009,4,This is delicious but I must warn you that it is like a dessert and very sweet.  I only added 1/2 cup of sugar and it still was too sweet.  Probably won't make again but thanks for sharing.
6/18/2009,4,This is really good but a little too sweet in my opinion.  Next time I will decrease the sugar but other than that it is terrific.
2/2/2009,4,I'm rating it a 4 only because it made way to much and I didn't get to enjoy it much as I was the only one to eat it. But its a very high 4. This is the recipe I've been looking for for many yea...
2/1/2009,4,First time I made this it was good (4 stars)-- a fancy mashed sweet potato but the 2nd time I doubled the nuts and added an extra egg and it was much better (5 stars) as it had more texture an...
1/1/2009,4,This casserole had a good taste and was pretty easy to make.  It was a nice change from the regular sliced sweet potatoes that we usually have for Thanksgiving.  Next time I will keep it a bit c...
12/25/2008,4,This was very good as the recipe is written - most in my family really enjoyed and now request me to prepare it for holiday meals.  I however think the butter flavor is way too strong and overpo...
12/6/2008,4,This turned out pretty good.  I did reduce the sugar a bit and will probably reduce the amount of butter on the topping next time.  I would make ths again.
12/1/2008,4,Seemed a little heavy to me. May have needed another egg & more milk
10/21/2008,4,Very good!
6/15/2008,4,this was good. I liked it very much I just cut down the sugar a little bit because the brown sugar topping will balance it out nicely. A good side dish for sunday dinners or holiday dinners!
3/26/2008,4,This dish is really wonderful.  I used considerably less sugar (they are sweet potatoes after all) and only one egg to about 5 cups of sweet potatoes and then placed in a 9x9 glass baking dish. ...
1/29/2008,4,It was very good. Next time I'll use less sugar. Also the pecans don't taste well reheated the next day; will substitute.
1/18/2008,4,Very tasty however the texture was a bit rubbery and the recipe did not serve 16 people..it was more like 12.
1/16/2008,4,I expected this recipe to be the tops with all the rave reviews but I honestly found it to be a bit bland. I followed it as written except I used walnuts instead of pecans since thats what I had...
1/5/2008,4,This recipe was really easy and it tasted really good so a definite keeper in our house.  Be careful with the sugar though - be sure to add only the white sugar to the potato mash and reserve t...
12/28/2007,4,This is a great recipe with a few changes. I only used 1/3 cup sugar in the mashed sweet potatoes & it was as sweet as pie. I used soy milk and seasoned the potato mixture with 1 tsp cinnamon an...
11/25/2007,4,This was my first attempt at baking such a dish for my latin family and everyone loved it!!  This recipe had the perfect amounts of flavors with the added suggestion of adding the cinnamon nutm...
11/24/2007,4,I thought this was a very good dish. The topping was not as crumbly as i expected it to be while putting it on the sweet potatoes before baking. But it turned out to look very pretty when it fi...
11/24/2007,4,"This dish was a big hit at our Thanksgiving dinner. I used black walnuts instead of pecans and everyone loved it!
Thanks for a great & easy recipe!"
10/11/2007,4,I used a 1 1/2 qt casserole dish which was too small for the topping.  I have had better sweet potato casserole.  I will use my old recipe.
8/4/2007,4,Not bad but still looking.
7/25/2007,4,You really have to be a sweet potato fan to like this recipe.
12/29/2006,4,This was good my adul kids liked it but all said it was on the sweat side..
12/27/2006,4,I got so many compliments on this dish
12/26/2006,4,I have made this recipe many times now often during the holiday season. I'm giving it only four stars though because I find it too sweet in its literal incarnation. I usually put in 1/3 cup lig...
12/9/2006,4,THIS WAS VERY GOODI USED LESS SUGAR AS OTHERS SUGGESTED AND IT WAS PLENTY SWEET.
11/29/2006,4,This was really good. I am giving it 4 stars and not 5 since I had to cut the sugar in the potato mixture to 1/3 cup. That was plenty sweet! Keep the topping just like it is though- perfect. I ...
11/27/2006,4,Will be making this again for Christmas.  Will try to remember to take a photo too. The one listed isn't very appealing.  Mine was very pretty.    I made this for Thanksgiving.  Used pecan halve...
11/26/2006,4,Very good latkas (or potato pancakes depenting on who's talking).  They weren't quite a 5 but still good.  I'll make them again when the mood takes me. And do squeeze out as much water as poss...
11/25/2006,4,I used Splenda in place of the white sugar to cut back the calories a bit as well as 1/3 cup butter instead of 1/2 in the potatoes and it was very good. Next time I will cut back the amount of ...
11/25/2006,4,made for thanksgiving rather tasty! added more pecans per choice plan to make again soon!
11/25/2006,4,Very Sweet! I loved it- my hubby did not- he likes things a little more savory- you may even want to put it in a pie crust and serve it for dessert.
11/24/2006,4,very good....
10/24/2006,4,I love this recipe!  I just need to figure out how to make it dairyfree!
9/28/2006,4,Excellent recipe.  Very tasty.
9/26/2006,4,Very good.
9/26/2006,4,I personally don't like sweet potatoes but my girlfriend and mother both really liked this recipe.  I didn't change a thing.
4/17/2006,4,The potato part of this dish was very good however I could not get the topping to crumble. It still was a good standard sweet potato casserole dish.
4/16/2006,4,Very nice side dish that my family loved. I halved the sugar and do to allergies I used toasted walnuts in lieu of the pecans. Thank you so much Suzanne!
12/27/2005,4,I thought it was too sweet but others thought it was not sweet enough so...
12/25/2005,4,I'm reasonably sure I'd give this recipe 5 stars if I'd baked it at the recommended temperature and time.  I was warming a fully cooked ham at lesser temperature however and tried to adjust fo...
12/15/2005,4,Very Good But very sweet!!  Will make again because my family insists!!!
12/5/2005,4,very good.  I think it would be even better in a smaller dish but did not try.
11/28/2005,4,My guests loved them. I liked them ok.. maybe a little dry.
11/28/2005,4,It was very good my family liked it at Thanksgiving even my brother!
11/24/2005,4,These were good but to me still a little dry and needed more flavor. But all in all a good recipe.
11/24/2005,4,I used Sweet potatoes like the recipe called for - not yams...and I thought they were perfect and not too sweet.  I wondered whether some of the other reviewers had used yams..which I think woul...
11/1/2005,4,GOOD BUT BETTER WITHOUT VANILLA.
12/21/2004,4,Got tons of compliments but it was a little too sweet for me.  Next time I'll reduce the sugar (and fat) by half.
11/29/2004,4,This was a good recipe but very sweet! I am usually the one with the sweet tooth but this recipe was so rich I couldn't eat too much of it. I would suggest cutting down on the amount of sugar.
11/24/2004,4,Oh my Gosh!  Are you sure this isn't a dessert???
10/7/2004,4,Tasty but make sure to have lots of salty dishes to go with it.
12/14/2003,4,I decreased the sugar in this recipe (in both the topping & the potato mixture) to a very scant 2/3 cup. This kept it from being so sweet that it tasted like a dessert instead of a side dish. Ev...
11/27/2003,4,This was really good. I have never liked sweet potatoes but decided to make this recipe for my inlaws Thanksgiving Dinner. They all said they werent too fond of sweet potatoes but they all love...

10/9/2012,5,WOW! this were amazing!
10/9/2012,5,"these were great!! I added more cinnamon which made the spices stand out a lot more. 
Everyone who tried them LOVED them!!
I would make these over regular pancakes any day :-D"
10/9/2012,5,I'm always trying to get my kids to eat more veggies and these pumpkin pancakes were by far the best I've ever made.  I used Maple Grove's whole wheat pancake mix (2.5 cups) and added the spices...
10/8/2012,5,Made it as is just used apple cider vinegar in lieu of regular (I had no white vinegar). Turns out amazing every time! I add pecans as jack-o-lantern faces for some extra flavor and a fun trea...
10/7/2012,5,Delicious even my picky family loved them!
10/7/2012,5,These were great. I just realized that I didn't put in the oil or the vinegar but mine still turned out great... maybe because I used sour milk the vinegar wasn't necessary. I put in an extra 1/...
10/7/2012,5,Wonderful!  The batter was thick but it made it a bit easier to work with for my daughter who is a novice cook (and chose this recipe).  They were nicely spiced .  She cut them with cookie cutt...
10/6/2012,5,I loved this recipe.  Ive been enjoying them for a few years however they are very thick pancakes and I have been trying to make them thinner.  I stumbled upon whole wheat pastry flour and love...
10/6/2012,5,Easy peasey to make and so most. We add some whipped cream instead of syrup
10/6/2012,5,Made the recipe exactly as stated except I subbed out 3 tsps of pumpkin pie spice instead of the spices listed.  Same thing I was just feeling a little lazy.  They were very fluffy and moist. ...
10/5/2012,5,This is an excellent recipe. I used it for waffles and they were awesome. Thank you for this recipe.
10/4/2012,5,Like the spices of winter? I added extra ginger cinnamon allspice and nutmeg. Very spicy it was almost hot to the tongue! But a perfect texture: like eating a spiced hot miniature pillow.
10/4/2012,5,I have made pumpkin pancakes before but they are often too dense to cook well.  I had leftover fresh pumpkin in the fridge and I decided to give this a try - it was WONDERFUL!  I did make one ch...

9/25/2012,5,Delicious!  Very fluffy but not too light.  I missed adding the vinegar until the flour was in so I let the batter rest a few minutes and it became bubbly and perfect.  I rarely ever separate m...
9/24/2012,5,We used Wheat Flour in place of the all-purpose flour and they were delicious!
9/23/2012,5,Agree with letting vinegar and milk stand as well as adding extra pumpkin and cinnamon.  For ease used a 15 oz. can of Libby Pumpkin Pack.  Also added 1/2 cup of chopped pecans.
9/9/2012,5,I've made these a couple of times when we had company. Everyone loved them! Better than regular pancakes.
9/1/2012,5,I love pancakes AND pumpkin so this seemed like the perfect match! The only things I did differently was add a bit of vanilla and a little more cinnamon since I didn't have any allspice.  These...
8/28/2012,5,I was trying to find something to make for breakfast knowing we had very little food left in the house. I didn't have any regular white sugar so I thought all hope was lost. However I reluctan...

4/22/2012,5,Followed original recipe exactly as written...best pancakes ever!
4/22/2012,5,These were amazing!  Hearty delicious and perfect just as written!  The ONLY thing I did differently was add flaxseed because I add that to everything I can.

4/17/2012,5,Excellent pancakes! Perfectly mild pumpkin spice flavor~ Love'm!

4/5/2012,5,Even better than the other pumpkin pancakes I was making! Subbed dry pancake mix for the dry ingredients and added applesauce in place of 1/2 the oil.
4/4/2012,5,A little less sugar a little more salt. Perfect!
4/3/2012,5,This recipe was amazing!  My husband and I are health nuts so I changed the milk to almond milk white flour with 2 1/2 cups Spelt flour used rapadura sugar instead of brown and added 1/8 tsp ...
3/26/2012,5,VERY GOOD!  Good pumpkin taste not overly sweet.  I used white sugar instead of brown because it was what I had on hand.  Still tasted fantastic.  Also added a dash of nutmeg and some ground fl...

3/14/2012,5,These are great. I used 1 cup AP flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour. I also omitted the vinegar and used buttermilk instead of milk and replaced the allspice with nutmeg. Awesome thank you :)
3/11/2012,5,Remade this recipe today and substituted the flour for Oat Flour + 3tbs of reg flour! Awesome!!!!
3/8/2012,5,Perfect!! I have been making these now for months everyone who has tried them loves them. The only thing I did different was to add lemon juice instead of vinegar.

1/24/2012,5,This is exactly what I was looking for.  I did add an additional egg as another person suggested.  My husband loved them! I served them with Pumpkin butter (from this site) and homemade syrup.
1/23/2012,5,These are great! Only change I made was used pumpkin pie spice instead of all the separate ones. I served them with fresh whipped cream :)
1/23/2012,5,Love this recipe.  It is also a great way to sneak in a vegetable in the morning.  My kids love them.  Great way to use that extra pumpkin in my freezer from Halloween.
1/21/2012,5,Amazing.  I keep the batter in the fridge for a couple days and eat them again & again. Keeper.
1/19/2012,5,Great anytime! I added 1 tablespoon white sugar 1/4 teaspoon clove 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg and 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract. I make a huge batch and then eat them for breakfast all week.
1/16/2012,5,Very good!
1/15/2012,5,These were bar none the BEST pancakes I have ever made for my family.  They turned out beautifully and I used every last drop of the batter to keep up with the demand.  First time ever!  Thank...

6/21/2009,5,I'm giving 5 stars even though I made a mistake.  My daughter was calling out ingredients to me from the computer while I was in the kitchen and she said only a 1/2 cup of milk.  I continued add...

5/6/2009,5,I love them.  The boys were not so thrilled.
4/10/2009,5,The best pancakes I have ever tasted bar none. Follw the reviews not to add any more milk: the batter is supposed to be thick and so I pour it as a circle into my nonstick and spread it a litt...
4/10/2009,5,Delicious!!  We loved them.  Cooked them at 300 deg since another reviewer recommended to cook at a slightly lower temp.  Spread them out a bit after putting batter on skillet.  Thanks for the g...
4/4/2009,5,Delicious!  I added white chocolate chips to make it more like pumpkin pie.
3/29/2009,5,My daughters raved about these. We put butter real maple syrup and a blob of whipped cream on top and they thought they were eating dessert!
3/28/2009,5,these were delicious. I made them just as the recipe says and the batter was a bit thick but they came out just fine (i like dense pancakes).  the recipe only uses 1 cup of pumpkin so you are l...
2/27/2009,5,Delicious!
2/25/2009,5,This recipe was great!  After making a few I added a little more spice some nutmeg and pumpkin but that is just to my personal preference.  Absolutely delicious with whipped cream!
2/24/2009,5,I made these the other night for my siblings. I could tell by the batter they were going to be perfect!! My siblings put peanut butter and maple syrup on them and they said they were sooooo goo...

2/13/2009,5,I upped the nutrition on these by substituting 1/4 cup garbanzo bean flour and 3/4 cup spelt flour for one of the cups of AP flour.  Added a handful of chopped walnuts and pumpkin seeds and a sp...
2/11/2009,5,Fantastic - we loved them
2/11/2009,5,I really liked these pancakes! The pumpkin/spices are a good addition to plain old boring pancakes. Next time I would like to substitute the vegetable oil for applesauce. Best with maple syrup ...
1/25/2009,5,Wow! These were fantastic. After reading the reviews I added an extra egg to the batter. Keeping the portions to 1/4 c. and spreading it out ensured they cooked beautifully. They had great text...
1/24/2009,5,I have to add my 5 stars to this recipe; it was outstanding with the kids (with some of my usual adjustments for high altitude and boosting the recipe up to 7 cps of flour).  Regarding the thick...
1/23/2009,5,Hint:  Due to the thickness of the batter make these pancakes small so the middle has time to cook through before they are overly browned or (godforbid) black!
1/10/2009,5,Absolutely delicious! I used fresh pumpkin - steamed (not boiled) & pureed in a blender. I followed the recipe exactly and these pancakes got rave reviews. Will definately be making these again....
1/4/2009,5,So good so fluffy.  I substituted half the flour with whole wheat and added 1 tsp vanilla and another tsp of brown sugar.  I let the batter sit for a few minutes and cleaned up while the baking...
1/3/2009,5,Awesome recipe.  Only variation was adding a little extra milk and vanilla.  Served with the cinnamon cream syrup also found on this site.
1/2/2009,5,These were absolutely delicious - we made them exactly as the recipe called for.  Will definitely make again and again.
1/1/2009,5,These were great as is.  The only thing that I did was use less milk (1 cup + 2 tbsp) because I like my pancakes thick.  Yum! Yum! Thanks for the recipe.
12/25/2008,5,these are awesome.  my 21 month old son keeps asking for these over and over and over!!  finally something he will eat for breakfast w/ no coersion needed!
12/25/2008,5,We made these pancakes for our Christmas breakfast and they were a big hit!  I did make a couple of changes.  I used 1/4 c (4 T) brown sugar and added an extra egg.  I also omitted the ginger (h...

11/28/2008,5,Some of the best pancakes we have ever had.
11/28/2008,5,I've made these a few times. My step-daughter doesn't like them much (not much of a pumpkin fan) but my boyfriend and I do. I even shaped them into lil pumpkins for breakfast on Halloween.
11/28/2008,5,These were excellent! Light fluffy and tasty. No need for butter just add a little syrup. I used the entire 15oz can of pumpkin and added chopped pecans. The leftovers were even great the next ...

11/20/2008,5,This recipe was delicious!  I used melted butter instead of oil.  I also did about 1.5-2 tsp. cinnamon and added about 1/2 tsp. cloves.  I had to add extra milk in order to get it thin enough to...

11/13/2008,5,My wife adds walnuts to these when I make them. We love them.
11/13/2008,5,Batter was definitely thick. Added more milk & it watered down the pumpkin flavor. Next time I'll make the recipe as is & spread the pancake batter out w/spatula on pan.
11/12/2008,5,Very very very yummy! I followed the recipe almost exactly but I didn't have allspice so I used a little bit of pumpkin pie spice. My only complaint would be that the spices weren't strong e...

12/1/2004,5,These pancakes are so good!  If you have thick pumpkin (Libby's etc) make sure you add an extra cup of milk and one extra egg.  If you have soupy pumpkin don't worry about it.  I added chocola...

11/21/2010,5,Delicious! I've made this recipe twice within the last few weeks. First time I made it my husband and I decided the spices were a little strong. Second time I cut those in half... perfect!!
11/19/2010,5,Mmmm. So easy and yet so good. I cut the chicken into long thick strips. I don't like having a huge chunk of meat to eat. That way the strips had more gooey sauce! I also covered the pan with ...

10/2/2007,5,This was so good -- and EASY! My husband took one bite and said you've got to make this again.  I changed the sauce slightly by adding a couple tablespoons of peach preserves to it. Then whi...
9/20/2007,5,Excellent and really easy to make. thank you
9/2/2007,5,I've used this recipe about 3 times now and it is one of the easiest dishes to whip up! All my guests have loved it. I paired with a Brushcetta pasta dish from this site and it turned out wonder...
8/31/2007,5,This was one of the best (and simplest) recipes I have ever tasted from this site (and my hobby is cooking).  I sort of eyed the ingredients and the sauce was unbelievable!!  Thanks so much!
8/24/2007,5,LOTS OF FLAVOR!!! Very good you have to put it in  a smaller dish and use less paprika.  Thank You
8/19/2007,5,Excellent the only thing I did differently was to reduce the mustard very slightly as the dijon mustard I use is very strong. This was quick and easy enough to make on a work night. My husband...
7/27/2007,5,This was fantastic! I made it with Dijon mustard as that's what I had but otherwise I stuck to the recipe. It was so tender and flavorful!
7/21/2007,5,Fantastic! Superb results! I will definitely make it again and serve it to guests at my dinner parties.
7/21/2007,5,very nice whole family loved it done with vegetables spot on.
7/19/2007,5,awesome! i've made this quite a few times. my boyfriend requests it on a regular basis.
7/17/2007,5,This was very tasty but I suggest having an extra batch of sauce at the table.  The sauce is pretty thin and drizzled off the chicken while cooking.
7/13/2007,5,Delicious!  I also allowed the chicken to bake in all of the sauce.  While baking I also recommend covering the dish with foil.
7/13/2007,5,"This was fabulous!!!!!! 
I will definately add this to my most used recipe book!!

6/26/2007,5,This is one of our favorites. I would say I follow the recipe but I never measure anything. When chicken is done I remove it from the baking dish turn up the heat and put the dish back in for a ...

3/31/2007,5,I made this for dinner and the family gobbled it up even my teenage daughter went for seconds...as did I which is rare. I served it with pasta and carrots. I didn't have enough honey so I add...
3/30/2007,5,Added a little bit of red pepper for zing and this was a hit with husband and teenager.  Leftovers were good over salad using the sauce as dressing.
3/19/2007,5,so good! for my side dishes i made rice and asparagus that i baked in the oven alongside the chicken. the rice was perfect for soaking up the extra honey mustard chicken juices when served.

7/29/2016,4,Simple...Fast...Yum!  Definitely don't consider myself a cook and I'm not a fan of spending a lot of time in the kitchen since my job doesn't leave me much down time.  This was a great dish that...

6/20/2016,4,Only thing I did different was to add 1/4 tsp of minced garlic and I used foil over the pan until the last ten minutes of cooking.
5/28/2016,4,One of my favourite meals to cook. I substitute the paprika for cumin and chili powder however and it makes quite the difference adding a nice smokey and spicy element to it.

10/28/2017,5,I make this for every event and it's always a hit!
7/1/2017,5,I quite enjoyed this although I did make a change. I put in about 3/4's of the package of spinach and it still needs more next time I'll just use the entire package.

6/22/2017,5,Tastes exactly like you want your spinach dip to taste!

10/22/2012,5,Hi my family has been making this recipe for many years. Only difference - we use dry vegetable soup rather than leek.  And of course let is sit overnight always better the next day!

6/21/2012,5,I went looking for Knorr Leek Soup but all I could find was Knorr Cream of Leek Soup - is that the one I should use for this recipe?
5/3/2012,5,Absolutely phenomenal!!!
4/21/2012,5,This was a big hit at a gathering I had to attend.  I used the entire package of spinach to add more substance.  I had to substitute the leek soup mix for Knorr Vegetable Recipe Mix and added a ...

4/22/2007,5,This is a winner every time.  I use light versions of everything I can and it always turns out awesome.  I find that veggie soup and leek soup are interchangeable and both are always a hit with ...
4/9/2007,5,I made this for Easter & my family raved!  They only stopped eating it when they ran out of bread.  I used light sour dream and light Miracle Whip instead of mayo.

3/16/2007,5,Spinach dip is outstanding! It makes alot and is nice a simple too. Perfect for easy entertaining.

2/6/2007,5,I get a lot of requests for this one.  Always use light mayo and light sour cream; tastes just as good.  Definitely better the next day!
2/1/2007,5,A hit at the office potluck!  I used the whole 10 oz box of spinach and added a bit of Cavenders Greek Seasoning (because I add it to everything}.  DELICIOUS!
1/27/2007,5,EXCELLENT!  THE BEST SPINACH DIP YOU CAN MAKE!  I normally make this without the water chestnuts.  Definitely must use the Leek Soup Mix.  I've tried it with the Vegetable Mix and there is a not...
1/25/2007,5,My whole family loves this.  If I show up at a family event without it they complain.  I use the whole 10oz package of spinich and I add some garlic powder as well.
1/19/2007,5,I had never made this with water chestnuts before. They do add a crunch to it but I liked it. I put it in a Hawaiian Sweet Bread bowl. It is by far may favorite way to serve it. I also used the...
1/14/2007,5,The old basic standby. Great at parties; everyone loves it. I use a tad more mayo Knorr's veggie soup mix and the WHOLE box of spinach. Yum!
1/13/2007,5,Utterly fantastic.  Great with bread crackers vegies anything.  Also works great as a sandwich topper as well.
1/12/2007,5,this is a great one.  used melba toast like crackers along with.  this doesn't freeze.  tried that with a mushy mess!  but got rave reviews at a party i served it at.  thanks.
1/8/2007,5,Everyone loves this dip you have to use the Leek Soup(not vegetable). Make it early so the flavors can blend so yummy...thanks.
1/4/2007,5,very good!  i made it using a whole package of spinach i could have used even more! i used onion soup mix instead of leek. also i served it in a pumpernickle bread bowl. every one loved it and ...
12/26/2006,5,easy & delicious!
12/24/2006,5,I LOVE this stuff!  I've only made it with Knorr's Veggie mix never have found the Leek - but I think it's just awesome stuff.  Sometimes I add a little minced garlic leftover veggies such as ...

12/9/2006,5,really good. i made with fat free sour cream & lite mayo - was great.  used 10oz spinach bag - even better. chilling is important - cause the soup mix is crunchy and needs to soften.
12/5/2006,5,Delicious. Have made the recipe many times. To squeeze the spinach dry I let it defrost pretty much completely and then I put it in a SALAD SPINNER. It works wonders and isn't as messy!!!
12/5/2006,5,I made this for a pot-luck at work. Now everytime there is a mention of food at work I am hounded to make this dip. Even non-spinach likers love it.
11/30/2006,5,I made this dip for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it! I used 3/4 cup mayonaise instead of a full cup and omitted the waterchestnuts and it was so yummy! I put the dip into pumpernickle bread a...

11/22/2006,5,The LEEK soup mix makes this dip.  I like it so much better than the one made with the veggie soup mix.
11/19/2006,5,This is the best spinach dip ever.  Thanks for sharing.
11/12/2006,5,My friends raved about this recipe and said that it was the best spinach dip they ever had!  As other suggested I used a whole package of spinach and it was perfect!
11/6/2006,5,Even the guys dug into this at a recent party I had ... and that's saying something with my friends!
11/1/2006,5,Awesome. Can't stop eating it.
9/22/2006,5,Had to leave out the water chestnuts but this is great!  The leek soup really makes the dip. I used a 10 oz. pkg. of spinach and it's just right.  Definitely needs to chill overnight to blend t...
9/10/2006,5,Was gobbled down by all no complaints only rave reviews. Just like my mom makes. I tried it with vegetable soup mix by Knorr and it was fabulous.
7/27/2006,5,I think the best part of this recipe is the bread bowl idea- the sour dough bread with the dip was a terrific combination. Also I did not half the spinach as the recipe suggests. I used a whole...
7/22/2006,5,"Tasty! I used Knorr Vegitable soup mix. I like it a lot with just half the spinach. A definate keeper! The bowl was empty in about 5 minutes at the party!

7/11/2006,5,Just what I was looking for!  Great dip and a hit at our BBQ!
7/10/2006,5,People actually tear the bread bowl apart to get every last bit of this dip. Sometimes I add the entire package of spinach.
6/21/2006,5,This was really good! I ate it with tortilla chips instead of the loaf of sourdough. Next time I will make it with low fat mayo because it felt so sinful with the full fat mayo.
6/16/2006,5,Love this recipe. I've made a couple of adjustments: add 1/2 cup of fresh grated parmesan and use all 10oz of the spinach.
6/11/2006,5,This recipe is so simple and easy.  I never have leek soup mix on hand but I've used onion soup many times and the recipe always comes out great!
6/7/2006,5,So good! I serve it with crackers instead of bread and use a whole package of spinace.  I always get asked for the recipe!!
6/6/2006,5,Excellent recipe I have made this several times for different parties and I have recieved compliments every single time and have even given out this recipe to others.  THANKS!!
6/3/2006,5,I used low fat mayo and sour cream and it turned out great.

5/25/2006,5,This truly is the best spinach dip ever! Everyone loves when I make this for parties and family events!
5/16/2006,5,So rich and delicious! We like to eat it with pita chips. Before I was using a recipe with plain nonfat yogurt. Mayo is WAY better and I'm never going back!
5/13/2006,5,"Truly is the Best Spinach Dip Ever. Ever time I go to a party people ALWAYS tell me to bring it.

(PS-I cut out the water chestnuts)."
5/4/2006,5,great recipe...have tried lightening it up with light mayo and sour cream. light mayo and light sour cream maintain a good consistency but fat free sour cream makes it a bit runny. yum!
5/2/2006,5,Very good.  Just what I wanted.
4/13/2006,5,Awesome recipe.  I changed it a bit and used pumpernickel bread and instead of dry leek mix used onion soup mix but result was awesome and a hit at the party.
4/2/2006,5,This dip really was a hit - I made it about 4 hours in advance and chilled it threw it in a breadbowl with bread pieces and triscuts for dipping and everyone LOVED it! There wasn't a morsel lef...
3/26/2006,5,The name says it all!!  This was amazing.  I didn't have leek soup so I used vegetable soup.  No one could stop eating it.  Thanks!!
3/18/2006,5,Very good.  Next time I make it I think I will add parmesan cheese and some scallions.
3/16/2006,5,Excellent.  Marinated in fridge for 24 hours.  I also doubled the recipe but only used 24oz sour cream.  Served with Sweet bread and scoops. (Yum)
3/13/2006,5,I agree with the title.  I love a good spinach dip and this is surely one of the best.  Took it to a going-away party and it was gone in record time.  Thanks for the recipe Shawna.

2/6/2006,5,Took this to a Super Bowl party and received rave reviews and it was consumed at amzing speed!  We used a sunflower bread (baked it for 15 minutes at 375 after hollowing out to make it firmer) a...
2/3/2006,5,Awesome!!!!!
2/2/2006,5,I loved this recipe! I served it at a get-together and it was gone in 5 minutes! I did not add as much mayo as called for (just a little bit less). Also the grocery store here did not carry lee...
1/30/2006,5,This is a keeper!  Everyone loved it.  Even the kids couldn't get enough.  Definitely try making it with the leek soup it does make a difference.
1/29/2006,5,This spinach dip is the best that I have ever tried! I believe that the secret ingredient is the dry leek soup rather than the vegetable soup. I added diced red and yellow bell peppers for color...

1/16/2006,5,Deserves the name; quick easy and great for parties.
1/12/2006,5,This dip is great and so simple to make.  I get requests to bring this to every party I go to.  I make it lower fat by using light mayo and sour cream.
1/10/2006,5,I made it for New Years Eve and everyone loved it. I only used it as a dip. I bought tortillas and cut them into triangles and fried them into tortilla chips and used it for scooping the dip.
1/4/2006,5,This was excellent.  The only change I made was using less mayo.  the first time I made it the mayo taste was overpowering.
1/1/2006,5,Only changes I made were to use the entire box of spinach and adding chopped green onion. I recommend refrigerating for at least 36 hours before serving; it was even better the second day. A fav...
12/31/2005,5,The Best!
12/30/2005,5,I made this appetizer for Christmas Eve dinner and everybody LOVED it!!! We ran out of dip before the bread because people piled it on. I made it the night before and it made things easier on me.
12/26/2005,5,This IS the best spinach dip ever! My guests on Christmas couldn't get enough. I used an Italian round bread I didn't have any sourdough. I also used about 3/4 of the spinach package. It just n...
12/26/2005,5,Very very good bread bowl dip! Highly recommend it!
12/26/2005,5,Exceptional dip.  Followed recipe with the exception of a whole bag of spinach.  Got the water out of the spinach buy wringing it in paper towels.  Everyone loved it.

12/2/2005,5,Very Good. Added some crumbled bacon that I crisped in the microwave and some chopped red pepper to make it more festive to the top only.  Also surrounded with some red and green swirled Italian...

3/5/2004,5,This recipe is a classic.  Add more frozen chopped spinach though.  (Thawed obviously.)  And use Knorr's Vegetable/Leek soup mix.  I have used pumpernickel bread before and that is tasty too...

3/2/2004,5,This was a great recipe. Quick and easy. Everyone loved it. Thanks!
2/22/2004,5,I always hated spinach on its own or in anything until I tried this recipe.  I know what I'll be making for the next company smorgasboard!
2/12/2004,5,Muy delicioso!!! I couldn't find the leek soup mix so I substituted veggie dip mix. It was wonderful! This was the first to go at a recent event! My mom's friend a self proclaimed Connoisseur ...
2/6/2004,5,Wow!  This was so easy and delicious!  I doubled the water chestnuts for more crunch.  The hard part was finding the leek soup mix.  I finally found it at Safeway (Knorr's).  I sprinkled a littl...
1/23/2004,5,I've made this dip for a few functions and each time it's always the first to disappear!  The water chestnuts give a perfect bite and the leek soup mix (I used cream of leek) was a nice alter...
1/9/2004,5,this is an easy and wonderful recipe and I hae been using it for years.  It is often ruined by newcomers as they use whipped dressing (Miracle Whip type) instead of MAYONNAISE (Hellman's type). ...

12/24/2003,5,We tried this for an open house and it is excellent. KK Minnesota
12/19/2003,5,I have been searching for a good spinach dip recipe. I didn't want anything too fancy or obscure this is perfect because it's a traditional spinach dip but with an added flare with the water c...
12/17/2003,5,Awesome dip!  I played around a bit and added shredded carrots & green onions. I also used hawaiin bread instead of sourdough. It was a big hit at the office christmas potluck.

Don't change a thing its perfect."
12/11/2003,5,Wonderful recipe!!!  I've made this 4 or 5 times now and EVERYONE loves it even my friend who hates mayonnaise.  If I have some left over (which is rare) it makes a nice sandwich spread on so...

11/28/2003,5,My family ate this all up. I agree with another woman ~ the colder the better. Mine was in the fridge for about 12 hours and it was great.
11/26/2003,5,Perfect as is my family always asks me to make it!!!
11/19/2003,5,"I didn't put the water chesnuts in. i don't care much for the flavor.
i ended up putting this in the blender. the flavor was even and the texture was creamy."
11/4/2003,5,Absolutely out of this world.  I was hesitant about the dry leek soup mix but it adds a different flavor then the usual spinach dip that makes it stand out.  To add a little color suggest addin...

8/25/2003,5,This is a delicious recipe.  My son can't get enough.  That is why I have to limit how often I make this one.  It is a great dip for parties.
8/20/2003,5,Excellent. Made it for a party and everyone kept asking for the recipe. Althought great I would use a little less mayo next time.
8/12/2003,5,So good!  I have made it before with vegetable soup dip but the leek soup is very good.  This is my new favorite way to make spinach dip.  I hope there is some left for the baby shower I am sup...
8/6/2003,5,This dip was wonderful!  I added some grated parmesan and used less mayo than the recipe said.  I couldn't find the leek soup either but did find cream of spinach soup (made by Knoll).  It was ...
7/22/2003,5,Very tasty...It really makes a difference to let it sit and let the flavours blend (I left it overnight)  Next time I will add some chopped red bell pepper mostly for appearance.  Thanks for the...

6/12/2003,5,This was the best Spinach dip and the first time we ever made it ourselves. We went to a friend's and brought three other dips and forgot to make this one. My husband made it the next day and we...
6/9/2003,5,took to a big office party and it was a great hit! I am always looking for the ultimate appetizers this is a good one
5/28/2003,5,D-licious!!!!!  I added a half of a small white onion and a clove of garlic (which was really too much a half a clove will do)to mine because I'm a huge garlic and onion fan.  It tasted like th...

4/2/2003,5,Very yummy and easy!
3/25/2003,5,This is the Best!  The only thing I changed was to add one full package (10oz) of spinach (vs. the 1/2 of package like the recipe suggested).  I just felt it wasn't enough spinach for my likings...
3/25/2003,5,This is a great recipe.  I use the whole package of spinach after I drain it well. I also add 3 green onions cut up. The flavor is great especially the next day.  Enjoy!

1/24/2003,5,Best and easiest Spinach Dip!  I used the whole box of spinach (the spinach has to be squeezed dry.)  The leek soup mix is a nice change from onion soup mix - milder flavor and not as salty.  G...
1/23/2003,5,This was a yummy dip. I added chopped onion. This was great and making it again for super bowl Sunday.
1/20/2003,5,The best. Absolutly beats the one where you use the veggie dip mix. Make sure you squeeze as much water from spinach as possible.
1/20/2003,5,Yep!  Just as yummy as everyone said!  The water chestnuts were a great addition and I did use all the spinach as others recommended.  Big hit with guests!
1/10/2003,5,How about easy.  I got the wrong spinach; I started making it 30 minutes before I needed - WOW - it was still terrific!  Got rave reviews!
1/4/2003,5,I rated this recipe last year with only 4 stars. At that time I was turned off by the idea of the water chestnuts so I left them out. I made this again last week for a party and this time I incl...
1/3/2003,5,Very very good. I also used the whole box of spinach. For those of you who tried onion soup & didn't like it try leek. It's milder. Knorr's makes it and it's usually in the same place where y...

12/28/2002,5,"I make this recipe its the best.
The only thing i do different to mine is I add one green onion chopped.  If you cant find the Knorr Leek soup use the Knorr Vegetable soup."
12/27/2002,5,i origionally wanted to do the knorr's spinich recipe but the store was out of the veggie dip.  i remembered this recipe and got the leak mix instead.  i was not dissappointed in the least an...

12/21/2002,5,Best ever says it all!!  I loved it (as did all my party guests) and I don't eat anything with mayonnaise.  Luckily I didn't put all of the dip out at the party.  So I enjoyed the leftovers...

12/12/2002,5,A great recipe.  I used all the spinach as was suggested and that's the way to go!  I also used Triscuits (Vegetable) instead of bread.  It was a great combination too!
12/1/2002,5,What a great recipe. I made it for Thanksgiving and it was wonderful. I added the whole box of spinach and the water chesnuts added a nice crunch.
11/29/2002,5,I took this dip to a house-warming party and it was a big hit!!! I added the whole box of spinach though. The water chesnuts were an excellent addition to this recipe. Very Good :)
11/29/2002,5,I was amazed at what a hit this dip was when I served it at my Thanksgiving dinner. Almost everyone asked me for the recipe! It was by far the star attraction of my dinner table.  Thank you!
11/29/2002,5,Easy to make and delicious. Used whole box of spinache and pumpernickle bread. It was a hit.
11/28/2002,5,This stuff is great! Very addicting. We make it almost every month now and STILL it's excellent. I was hesitant about the water chestnuts but they add a great crunch. It's perfect the way it is.
11/23/2002,5,"I gotta tell ya this is by far the best tasting spinach dip I have ever eaten.
Everyone loves this dip in my houseand my co workers raved over it when I took some to work today. AWESOME!!!!"
11/12/2002,5,this certainly is one of the best i have had ! it was a hit with my whole family ! thanks !

10/27/2002,5,Great recipe.  I make it when we go to parties and it is always a hit.  Sometimes the leek soup mix is hard to find but well worth it.
10/23/2002,5,YUMMM!!  My old recipe is now in the trash.  This recipe makes a ton of delicious dip which was gone after about 20 mins at my last party.  I also used veggies and breadsticks for dipping.  I kn...

9/8/2002,5,Excellent recipe!!!  This dip practically disappeared in a flash at my party.  This is by far the best spinach dip i have ever tasted.  I used low fat mayo and it was just as delicious.
8/10/2002,5,Delicious!!!  I used the whole 10oz. of spinach and made sure to squeeze all the liquid out before adding. YUM!
7/22/2002,5,This recipe is so easy - and the taste is amazing!!  I used a whole package of spinach instead of the half a package and divided the dip between a loaf of sourdough and a loaf of pumpernickel.
7/3/2002,5,Delish!  I almost omitted the water chestnuts and I'm so glad that I didn't--they added a wonderful crunch.  The recipe makes a lot next time I'll make a half batch.
7/2/2002,5,I think this turned out well. Not too thick.
6/23/2002,5,This was a very good spinach dip but you really need the whole box of spinach.  I have always made the spinach dip on the back of the Knorr Vegatable soup mix box and it is very good also.  I re...

3/17/2002,5,Very nice dip.  I used vegetable soup mix (couldn't find leek) low fat mayo and sour cream and rye bread instead of sourdough.  It went quickly at the party thanks.

This is the one!  It was so good (and my husband loved it as well)!  I will definitely make it..."

12/23/2001,5,This is exactly the recipe I have been looking for!! I'm not real fond of water chestnuts so I left them out and this turned out GREAT!! Very easy and quick recipe. Thanks!
12/23/2001,5,This recipe was FANTASTIC.  We bought a round sourdough loaf from Panera bread and hollowed out a bit of the middle.  We also bought another loaf to cut up for dipping.  It was PERFECT.  Thanks ...

3/4/2001,5,This is the same recipe I use; it's a hit every time!
3/1/2001,5,Delicious I will make this dip for every party. It's quick and easy and very tasty..I used pumpernickle bread it was really good. I also cut up carrots and celery to add on the side of the plat...

12/27/2016,4,I made this as instructed. It was a hit.
12/21/2016,4,Everyone enjoyed it. I used vegetable soup mix. Next i will try the leek mix.
8/25/2016,4,The leek soup mix in this works great.  The dip is wonderful and always devoured with glee. I doubled the amount of spinach which I recommend.
7/1/2016,4,I've made this for years Except - I'm not crazy about strong onion flavor.  So instead of Leek or Onion I have always used a full pkg of spinach 1pkg of Knorrs Spring dressing mix and a dash ...
12/31/2015,4,I used Knorr vegetable soup mix rather than Leek...not a fan of dry cream soup mixes.  I also used 1 cup mayo and 1 cup of sour cream...added a little of hot sauce to kick it up a notch
12/24/2015,4,I used extra sour cream toasted almonds and added Dijon Tony Tchatcheties and Tapatio hot sauce. I also used onion soup couldn't find leek only use about ½ pack. Out skittle in Tate and adju...
11/28/2015,4,Very good! I sometimes substitute 2 vegetable soup mix packets for leek soup. I also like a lot of spinach- so I use 20 oz of chopped spinach.
11/25/2015,4,Made this more times than I can tell just taking the time to post this. Many recipes out there but the LEEK soup mix is a MUST to make it taste like this. People will ask why yours tastes bette...
10/3/2015,4,Very good and tasty. The bowl was empty in a very short time.
8/10/2015,4,People just gobble this up very good! I'm giving four stars because  I use an 8 oz can of water chestnuts- and the whole box of spinach so it's probably thicker than intended but can't imagin...

1/16/2015,4,I make this with plain greek yoghurt and then cut the mayo and sour cream down by half. Still rich and delicious and people love it. Gets gobbled up every time.
1/15/2015,4,Did this with all the same ingredients except used the Knorr's dry vegetable soup mix. and it was not to much onion flavor (even though I like onion dip) this is a Spinach dip. The flavors cam...
1/8/2015,4,Very tasty and easy to make. I couldn't find the dried leek soup at my grocery so I used the vegetable instead. It was still good.
12/29/2014,4,This recipe is fantastic - but requires 1 big change to be good. I used half of the soup mix amount it mentioned and it was fine. It would have been WAY too oniony otherwise. I also used an enti...

4/7/2014,4,Very Good!! We liked this a lot.
2/16/2014,4,Great recipe! Tasted great and slightly addicting. Only change was that I used 16 oz of spinach.
2/11/2014,4,It was good and easy to make which is why I gave it 4 stars but to be honest I've had better.  I felt that it lacked flavor. Will probably look for a different recipe.
1/28/2014,4,This is a great recipe! I always add a chopped onion and a whole package of spinach.  A crowd pleasure for sure!
1/25/2014,4,If you don't care for the onion flavoring try a packet of Ranch dip seasoning (Hidden Valley is prob the best). I have had it both ways and I am more of a Ranch girl. I have made this for many...
12/14/2013,4,I have made this often but I use the Knorr Vegetable Soup mix.  It is much better & you can also add artichokes to change it up.  But it is a very good dip & I make it often.
12/12/2013,4,Really good.
12/1/2013,4,Couldn't find the leek soup mix locally so used the vegetable and it still turned out good. I skimped on the water chestnuts because I was unsure of them but next time I won't because they were...
11/30/2013,4,Very good! I love spinach dip and have always made it with Knorr vegetable mix but using the leek soup mix was equally delicious! Other than using the whole package of spinach I made no signifi...
8/12/2013,4,I have tried this but I used the recipe on the back of the Knorr package. It is found in the soup section in the store. I bought a round Hawaiian bread carved out the center to make a bowl and ...
7/6/2013,4,This was pretty good. I didn't love it but I'm not usually the type to love packaged soup flavorings. I took it to a bridal shower with a veggie tray and it wasn't a huge hit. I did leave out t...
4/12/2013,4,Nice recipe. Add 4 or 5 chopped green onions & 1/4 cup parmesan cheese and it is amazing! Make sure you chop the water chestnuts into small chunks so you get some in every bite!
12/19/2012,4,This very good however I hate using dry soup mixes in my dips never care for the taste so I left that out and added 1/2 tsp each onion powder and seasoning salt and 1 clove crushed garlic.  ...
9/2/2012,4,This is going to be a regular thing
7/19/2012,4,"Have made this recipe for twenty years. LOL! Dating myself by that comment. Had many requests for recipe. Only comment--- do not use Miracle Whip( my
Favorite dressing) it will not taste the sam..."
4/19/2012,4,very similar to the one I make all the time but I use cream cheese instead of sour cream and Knorr vegetable soup instead of the leek.  I grind the soup mix up so it dissolves better.  I use a ...
3/30/2012,4,Loved it but I did have to make changes.  I omitted the water chestnuts and added a can of chopped artichoke hearts I also used all 10 oz of spinach.
3/22/2012,4,I have made this twice recently.  The first time was very bland even though I followed the recipe exactly. The second time it was so much better and I used Miracle Whip because I was out of mayo...
1/17/2012,4,very good. I added a few things just to expirement. I could not find the leek soup mix. So I used the Knorr vegatable soup mix. I also used 2 packages of spinach. It makes it thicker which I lik...
12/26/2011,4,Yummy and easy
12/17/2011,4,Awesome recipe very simple and quick I usually double up the recipe since one sourdough bowl gets eaten quickly also I buy sourdough baguettes and cut to make a beautiful presentation alongsi...
12/5/2011,4,very good spinach dip.  The leak soup is definitely key to this recipe and the water chestnuts gave it a nice little crunch.  I would make again.
11/27/2011,4,Very tasty!
11/15/2011,4,"Good if you use the whole box of spinach like others suggested.  No complaints.

But I wanted it great and I love spinach so I added a second box of spinach 1/2 packet Knorr Vegetable Soup Mix..."
10/7/2011,4,Wonderful recipe. I added minced carrots for some color and also the entire box of spinach.
9/20/2011,4,made this for an anniversary party and people really enjoyed it it was gone fairly quickly and it is a good size recipe. This will be added as a favorite standby for me. thnks!!
9/6/2011,4,i do exatcely the same recipe expect i add two things dry itilian seasoning like the stuff u would get to make itilian dressing and bacon bits!!!....but i know that i just absolutly love ur ...
8/9/2011,4,I probably really shouldn't be rating this recipe because I only took bits and pieces from it but oh well.  I use 1 cup of mayo 16 oz. sour cream a package of Knorr's vegetable soup mix omit...
8/3/2011,4,very tasty.  very easy.
6/14/2011,4,I personally always add the full 10-12 oz package of spinach and the whole 8 oz can of water chestnuts. I also add a can of chopped artichoke hearts some minced garlic and some grated parmesan...
6/3/2011,4,Yep best ever! This was my moms go to spinach dip recipe for years though she used Knorr's Spring vegetable soup mix. I had to try the leek and am glad I did! Sooo good. I did double the recip...
4/1/2011,4,I did make some changes though... I didn't have water chestnuts so used pecans and I used a full 16 oz package of spinach.  Most people commented that they really liked the high spinach to crea...
2/7/2011,4,It was lacking flavor - not great just ok
2/5/2011,4,Pretty darned good! I took the advice of some other reviewers and used the whole 10 oz package of spinach.  It was just the right amount.  I couldn't find leek or onion soup mix at the store so...
1/28/2011,4,this is not yor dad's recipe. It is King's Hawaiian's recipe.
1/1/2011,4,Delish...only the knorr leek mix will do.  Use the whole 10 oz spinach.  We left out the water chestnuts the 2nd time around as they added nothing in our mind.
1/1/2011,4,Very Good! I followed the recipe exacly and took it to a New Year's party and it was the crowd favorite. I thought it had too much mayo/sour cream- even with the full package of spinach it was s...
12/31/2010,4,I use this recipe and always get rave reviews from those that I make it for.  I make a few variations I use more spinach then the recipe calls for. I use 15 ozs (about 1 and 1/2 packages of fro...
12/31/2010,4,Really good... but of course I must modify.  Used dry onion (couldn't find leek) soup.  One of the pkgs in the box.  Used whole bag (12 oz) of spinach and whole can (8 oz) of chestnuts.  Added ...
12/20/2010,4,Nice easy recipe. I use one whole box of spinach and I leave the water chestnuts out because I don't really like their texture or flavor. Making the dip the night before really does enhance the...
12/19/2010,4,For years I have been looking for a recipe like one my mother's coworker used to make at parties. This is as close as I have come and I was very happy with it. The leek soup mix gave it the fla...
11/24/2010,4,This recipe is a great base recipe but I found that adding green onions herb cream cheese (I used chive cream cheese) half the mayo leek soup mix and fresh garlic really amped this one up ...
11/12/2010,4,Always a hit! I just find that my dip always taste a bit powdery.. hmm. No one ever seems to mind!
10/24/2010,4,Great base recipe but neeeeds these changes to be 5-star (for my taste buds anyway)  I prefer a thick spinachy (if you will) dip as opposed to a mayo taste.  I used 2 1/4 cup sour cream 3/4 c...
9/4/2010,4,Very tasty but I used the whole package of chopped spinach.
7/22/2010,4,I made this using all sour cream. I loved the flavor of the leek soup mix in it.
7/2/2010,4,We enjoyed this alot! But I do feel like it needs something extra. I will make again for sure but will add additional ingrediants.
6/28/2010,4,This was good but I think I'll keep looking for the perfect dip.  To suit my tastes this dip would need to be thicker (less runny) and heartier (more spinach more water chestnuts more ?? -...
5/3/2010,4,I couldn't find the leek soup in any of the 3 different grocery stores that I checked at so I ended up using the dried vegetable one. I was still tasty though. I will be on the look out for the ...
2/18/2010,4,Easy and tastes great. Everywhere I bring it I'm asked for the recipe. I'm now the official spinach dip maker for family get togethers.
12/19/2009,4,I made this dish as an appetizer for a large Chrismtas party so I doubled the recipe. I too was unable to find dry leek soup so I substituted one package of onion soup mix and one of the veget...
11/24/2009,4,I always make my spinach dip in a Hawaiin Sweet Bread bowl instead. It makes it best without the water chestnuts and the whole box of frozen spinach as well!
11/10/2009,4,This recipe is identical to the KNORR Vegetable soup recipe for spinach dip found on the back of the package....still very good
11/3/2009,4,This is the first dip I've ever made and although I made a few changes I really enjoyed it!  I added minced garlic and cream cheese for extra flavour as well as adding extra spinach and a litt...
8/20/2009,4,Makes a lot.  Good for showers and big parties.
6/21/2009,4,This was good and easy to make. I let sit overnight and still didnt have too much taste though. I used a whole box of frozen spinach- that was the only change.
5/21/2009,4,simple and delicious my family ate it up and i wasint able to get any so i had to make more. I will be makeing it for our memorial day barbecue.
11/26/2008,4,I was a little nervous about making this dip because of the mayo but it was pretty good. I used light mayo and light sour cream. I added shredded romano cheese and used Lipton's onion soup mix b...
11/18/2008,4,While this is very good and went over big at a potluck I am not convinced its much different than any other homemade spinach dip I've tried.  I doubled the spinach in mine - it just didn't see...
11/9/2008,4,This was pretty good. It was very easy to make which I liked. I would make it again.
9/15/2008,4,This recipe is similar to the one that I make which is served warm - though my recipe has a few different ingredients. I always use a combo of sourdough and pumpernickle breads for variety when ...
7/19/2008,4,Wasn't five star good but it is good.  Wife took it to work and came back with nothing.  Even the bread bowl was gone.
7/9/2008,4,This recipe is super easy to make.  My aunt and cousin came down from California and gave us this recipe. We all fell in love with it.  I made it again for my other side of the family who i didn...
4/16/2008,4,I have been making this dip for many years except I use the whole package of spinach 1 1/2 cups sour cream and I always use Knorr vegetable dry soup mix. Everyone loves it and I get asked to...
4/14/2008,4,I think that this is probably my favorite cold spinach dip recipe.  My only recommendation would be that some guests founf the leek flavor too strong so I may cut down on how much of the soup...
2/2/2008,4,Agree with most others: add more spinach and cheese and you've got a pretty good dip!
1/18/2008,4,Very easy to make. I made it for a new years party and my guests all liked it. I thought it was good but not great. My friend makes one that is great next time I will ask her for her recipe.
12/26/2007,4,I made this as a Christmas dinner appetizer.  I put it in a round loaf of pumpernickel bread.  The mayo taste was a bit overwhelming for me so next time I might add more sour cream and less mayo...
12/25/2007,4,Basically the same recipe as my friends moms but with the most important ingrediant of all time to put it over the top 1 cup parmesean romano blend! now its the best spinach dip ever.
11/8/2007,4,This spinach dip is very good - I will add it to my favorite recipes and use it for gatherings/parties that I have.  I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the spinach.  I used frozen...
11/2/2007,4,Well I had to use the veggie seasoning instead of leek because my grocery store didn't have leek but the recipe was still a success. I doubled this recipe for a work event and everyone loved ...
9/26/2007,4,This is good.  It is missing something I just can't put my finger on what.
4/10/2007,4,This is a pretty good recipe I made it at Christmas-time and there were no leftovers after about an hour! I also recommend adding one or two chopped green onions to the mixture.
4/8/2007,4,I made this spinach dip for Easter.  Even though I had said I was brining the dip two others also made a spinach dip!!  This one got eaten and people started stealing the bread from the other ...
4/8/2007,4,It came out a little creamier than expected.  Not bad though.
4/4/2007,4,Very Yummy! The only thing I changed was a little more water chesnuts and also added diced red bell pepper for color and a little crunch.  Thank you so much!
1/2/2007,4,Very good.  I also used the Veggie soup mix instead of the leek but it still turned out great.
12/27/2006,4,I made this recipe a few days before I intended to serve it.  At first it didn't look or taste appetizing and I was a little nervous about serving it.  However after sitting in the refrigerator ...
10/10/2006,4,Real good recipe to serve for a gathering of friends.
7/26/2006,4,This was good.....but not great.  Seems like it was missing something.  Garlic maybe?  Anyhow the family wasn't crazy over it.
1/8/2006,4,This is a pretty good spinach dip. I wasn't able to find dry leek soup mix so substituted it with dry onion soup mix and also used reduced fat mayo.
12/28/2005,4,This dip is pretty good but I've tasted better.  I served this at my Christmas party and no one really commented on it.
12/20/2005,4,Very good dip. I used a whole 8oz can of water chestnuts and a full 10oz box of spinach. The leek flavor is great with the crunch of the water chestnuts. I did serve in a large pumpernickle bowl...
12/9/2005,4,Good dip but just a little too salty. I used the Knorr veggie soup mix and a whole box of spinach. Will make again.
11/15/2005,4,Good simple recipe.  I used double the amount of spinach and it turned out great.
5/26/2005,4,This dip was delicious! Definately a nice change from using the veggi. soup mix everyone loved it!
5/25/2005,4,My husband is not a fan of spinach dip but he liked this one (probably because it doesn't have a lot of spinach in it). I used Knorr herb soup mix instead of leek and aioli instead of plain ma...
4/19/2005,4,Best chilled overnight
3/6/2005,4,For a cold spinach dip this is quite tasty.  Like many others I too added doubled the amount of spinach.  Tastes great thanks for sharing.
1/18/2005,4,Very good.  Broil for the last couple of minutes of cooking to brown the top.  It's also plenty cheesey with less mozz on top.
11/28/2004,4,this recipe was very good but the spinach i think should be chopped as well.  I left out the water chestnuts and it was still tasty.
11/12/2004,4,"Very easy to make. Liked the texture the water chestnuts gave the recipe. 
I used vegetable soup mix(that worked well too) & cut up an extra loaf of bread for dipping."
2/26/2004,4,This came out very good everyone likes it a lot.  I agree on more spinach.  Next time I might try some chopped yellow or red bell pepper for crunch and color.
2/21/2004,4,This was really good and savory.  My family loved it.
1/31/2004,4,This was very good.  I made it for a birthday party.  People thought I had bought the dip and couldn't believe I had made it myself.  The bread for dipping is no where near enough.
12/29/2003,4,It was easy and well- received but I tripled the amount of spinach ( for color mostly.) Next time I will try light mayo ( whipped dressing is too tangy) and add more water chestnuts. Very good ...
12/29/2003,4,This dip was very good will make again. Everyone enjoyed it!
8/12/2003,4,I make this frequently and it always gets rave reviews. I have a hard time finding the leek soup mix so I use Knorr's Vegetable Soup Mix. The bread bowl presentation always looks nice at potluck...
6/10/2003,4,Great didn't have dry leek soup so I used vegetable dip!! perfect quick and easy. I also used the entire package of spinach.
5/23/2003,4,Very good but not the best I've had. I like the version with yogurt better - and it's not so fattening!! Great recipe when you don't have yogurt though!
3/26/2003,4,The name says it all!  I get nothing but compliments when I make it.  The leek soup is a great alternative to the traditional vegetable soup mix.  Try it you won't regret it!
2/2/2003,4,This is a good dip!  I also used the whole box of spinach and served in a hollowed out sweet bread bowl.
12/26/2002,4,This was good but not THE best I have made.  I along with all my guests think the recipe on the back of the Knorr's Vegetable soup box is better.  Very simialr but uses vegetable soup mix ins...
12/22/2002,4,This spinach dip is awesome! Water chestnuts add the final touch.
10/31/2002,4,I brought it in for an office potluck and it was a hit!  I used fat-free mayo and the entire package of spinach.
6/7/2002,4,Really easy and so good!
3/2/2001,4,A favorite of ours as well!  Instead of the leek soup I use a package of dry vegetable soup mix as a variation.
2/19/2001,4,Overall a quick and delicious spinach dip recipe.
4/30/2016,3,"Passable.

11/16/2015,3,I can't find the Knorr leek soup so used half of Lipton soup. Too oniony and salty.  Water chestnuts were a great touch but I like mine baked.
11/4/2015,3,I used the whole package of spinach and used ranch dressing dip mix instead of the leek soup. I added a little Nature's Seasoning to counter act the sweetness of ranch and it turned out amazing
10/18/2015,3,I didn't make this recipe but gave 3 stars out of respect to the submitter.    This is the recipe found on the back of Knorrs Vegetable Recipe mix pack.  It is the bomb when made with Vegetable ...
7/31/2015,3,Its the Knorr Spring Vegetable soup mix that makes this awesome!!!
4/16/2015,3,This is ok. 2 cups of sour cream was too much.
1/16/2015,3,This is a good basic recipe but if you really want some slamming flavor use vegetable soup and be sure to squeeze all the water out of the thawed spinach. Add a bunch of chopped green onions. T...
1/16/2015,3,I was going to make this as written but first I went to the Knorr website and they said to use the Vegetable soup mix and so I did. It was fantastic and had more colour and other flavour compone...
1/16/2015,3,I've made mine the same way for years.  No soup mix or water chestnuts but I add garlic either minced or powder and chopped green onio . I think mine is the best ever!
12/18/2013,3,It was okay but I wish I had made the tradtional recipe with the leek onion mix. The french onion soup mix was too overpowering.
2/9/2013,3,I left out the water chestnuts because of personal preference and served in a regular bowl instead of the sourdough. As others suggested I doubled the spinach to use the whole box...big mistake...
12/3/2012,3,"This is close to the best... but not the best!
I repace the Leek soup with Knorr Vegetable soup cop up one red onion & add a teaspoon of lemon juice... Trust me this makes a huge difference.  ..."
11/30/2012,3,Tried this version as I was out of the ingredients I usually use. I was okay a little to bland. More like onion dip. Once I altered it by adding 2 packs of thawed chopped spinach and about 1-2...
3/22/2012,3,This is a wonderful dip.
9/17/2011,3,I have  made this for years and I use 1 cup of Mayo and 1 cup of sour cream 1 leek soup mix 1 box of spinach 3 chopped green onions 1 can chopped water chestnuts mine is much better
6/14/2011,3,I personally add all the spinach plus chopped green onions and red bell pepper.  The water chesnuts add a nice crunch.  Plus 2 hours of refrigerator time is plenty if you are in a crunch.
1/10/2011,3,I have used a ranch recipe for years with great success. However I am always up for something new. I rate this 3 stars as is. However I found a similar recipe that uses 1/2 c. mayo (I used Kra...
12/27/2010,3,I read all the great reviews so tried it. It was ok. Husband didn't really like it. Maybe it was the chestnuts...not sure he liked the crunch. I liked it but felt it needed a little more flavor....
7/5/2009,3,Ok definitely not the best spinach dip ever. I used onion soup mix because my store didn't have leek. Maybe that makes all the difference. And I used all the spinach since it would have been b...
9/14/2008,3,This turned out pretty good. However when making again I wouldn't use sourdough. I would suggest King's Hawaiian bread (sweet bread). My local grocer didn't carry King's Hawaiian :( I would als...
6/18/2008,3,This was good but tasted a bit packaged. It wasn't to die for or anything and there were left overs. Usually when I make a dip with fresh ingredients it's gobbled up in no time.
11/8/2007,3,I didn't like the leek soup mix. I made it exactly the same witn Knorr vegetable soup mix and it was much better.
3/27/2007,3,i didn't love it.  too light on the spinach too heavy on the mayo and sour cream.  i think i'd go with adding the whole package of spinach!!
10/13/2006,3,This was OK but a little mayonaise-y for my taste.  I doubled the spinach but it was still not enough.  I will try another recipe next time.
4/27/2006,3,Eh.  It was ok don't know about Best Ever.  Couldn't find the dry leek soup mix so I had to use dry onion.  Guess its pretty good as far as spinach dip goes maybe a little too sour for my tast...
3/27/2006,3,Basic spinach dip.
12/21/2005,3,The taste was good but the amount of mayo and sour cream made it kind of watery.  Next time I will definitly use less!  Otherwise it was a good tasting dip.
9/28/2003,3,I used vegetable soup instead of leek and I think that was the problem.. maybe?  My boyfriend and I found this very bland. I will try to liven it up at a later date.
4/2/2003,3,Way to much sour cream for me.  Next time I'll reduce it & see how it goes.  I also prefer a thicker dip & I did add another pkg of spinach but it was just to watery  I think this recipe has g...
3/24/2003,3,This is very good.  I usually used spinach soup but will definately be using the leek soup from now on.  It adds a lot of flavor.
1/1/2003,3,No. It isn't the best ever. It's good but very mayonaise-y. Very very mayonaise-y. If you dig that flavor you'll dig this recipe. It's not my cup of tea though.
9/18/2002,3,I could not find the leek soup so I had to substitute onion and I wasn't very impressed.  Maybe that is because I am not a huge fan of onion soup but I was hoping for better from a recipe wit...
4/3/2017,2,This doesn't have much more flavor than spinach in sour cream.  I definitely would not recommend this to anyone.
2/2/2015,2,Ugh - the consistency is awful way off from others I've had made by others before.
1/23/2015,2,I didn't like the Knorr mix.  I think I will go back to using Lipton.  Thank you.
12/27/2013,2,Followed directions exactly it tasted just like onion dip with spinach.
4/6/2013,2,not a lot of flavor !!
1/6/2013,2,I am surprised by all of the amazing reviews - like some reviewers indicated it was like eating mouthfuls of mayonnaise. Made this for some guests (guys who will usually eat anything) and they...
1/6/2013,2,Not a fan.  I guess I like  cheesier version of spinach dip rather than the sour cream/mayo version.  Probably won't make this again.
5/28/2012,2,This recipe as is has zero flavor.  I had to add 1 tsp parsley flakes 1 tsp accent 1 tsp garlic powder and salt and pepper to make it edible.
12/17/2011,2,This dip was way too salty. If I make it again I would use half the soup mix.
2/24/2011,2,I made this because of the rave reviews and followed the recipe exactly (except for using low fat or fat free versions of everything.) I don't know if that's why it didn't taste good but it ju...
12/26/2010,2,Just okay...  too bland for me.
8/21/2010,2,I needed to make a spinach dip for our monthly teacher appreciation party; not one for dips--or anything laden with sour cream or mayo--I turned to allrecipes for some help.    Unfortunately th...
7/3/2010,2,As the recipe is written you might as well just eat mayo and sourcream out of the jar.  The modifications I made to it would bring it to 4 1/2 or 5 stars.  Up the spinach to 2 packages of froze...
12/15/2009,2,I followed the directions to the letter and used the Knorr Leek Soup Mix.  The water chestnuts gave it a nice crunch however all I tasted was onion dip.  Served in a nice bread bowl too ($4.00 f...
8/29/2007,2,My sister in law and I  both made spinach dip at the same function and hers was much better and came from a packet.
1/12/2007,2,Followed the recipe for the most part- used light sour cream instead.  My boyfriend wanted me to make some.  Can't say I was really impressed by it and neither was he.   It tasted like dip and I...

5/15/2005,2,This is a great spinach dip. I have to say it is the exact recipe on the back of the Knorr vegetable soup mix box only with a different soup mix. Personally I think it's better with the veg s...
11/26/2004,2,my family ate it  But told me they have had better.  Not a good.  It is good though.  Easy to make and all.  But because my family likes a more cheesey taste  I won't make again.  But for fam...
8/22/2004,2,What was I thinking?  For some unknown reason I thought using leek soup would make it different  - but even with extra spinach it still tasted like boxed onion soup.  Not bad - but not good.
12/9/2003,2,i made this dip thinking that it would be great. it wasn't. i agree with another reviewer that it has way too much mayo however it could be that i used whipped dressing not mayo. i may try it a...
4/14/2003,2,I made this recipe for a party this weekend. I doubled the recipe because the reviews were so high. Well this was the only appetizer that was barely touched at my party. I'll stick to Knorrs Ve...
12/25/2014,1,instead of mayo we mustard
3/22/2012,1,I've been making this for years and it's always a big hit. I add about 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese and double the spinach and increase the water chestnuts by 50%.
12/9/2011,1,I don't lilke posting negative reviews but I took this to a potluck yesterday and people barely touched it. There's way too much sour cream and mayo in here. You definitely need to use the entir...
12/16/2007,1,Best ever?  Not even close. The original recipe made with vegetable mix is much much better! I think the leeks made this one taste funny.
5/26/2006,1,My husband made this recipe because we had spinach dip at our favorite restaurant but this isn't it. The mayo was too much and gave it a strange taste. The mayo is a little different here in Au...
5/11/2006,1,This dip is way too sour. Also the water chesnuts have a very strange crunch to them. I much prefer spinach dip with a cream cheese base. Try the Hot Artichoke and Spinach Dip II also on this ...
5/3/2006,1,didn't care for this recipe.
1/18/2017,5,Excellent. The chicken came out perfect. I forgot the mozzarella but it was still great.
1/17/2017,5,I followed the recipe exactly as Chef John stated.  It wasn't the easiest dish in the world but this was definitely worth the minimal effort.  My family raved about this chicken Parm and begged...
1/16/2017,5,I will definitely make it again
1/16/2017,5,I think it was really good nice and cheesy I think the only thing that I would do differently is put a little more seasoning into the breading mixture.
1/16/2017,5,This chicken parmigiana was awesome.  Even my husband loved it and he is not much of a Italian lover.  I did not make any changes.  I will definitely make this again.
1/16/2017,5,I made this last night and it was sooooooo good! Definitely keeping this recipe!
1/16/2017,5,Great recipe!  My hubby is normally a pretty picky eater but this was cleared off his plate in 3 minutes flat! Delicious!
1/16/2017,5,Great recipe for a chicken parmesan beginner.  It was easy and the kids loved it!  I just eyeballed the cheeses and it turned out great.  Served it with Primus Cabernet and garlic bread and it m...
1/16/2017,5,Turned out pretty good! It's the first time I ever tried doing chicken parmigiana at home. I've customized the recipe with veggies - onion & bell pepper. It just tasted like restaurant made parm...
1/16/2017,5,Didn't have pants  used regular bread crumbs.  Still turned out amazing.  Think I would halve the portions though and serve with salad... Just finished eating  need a nap!   Excellent recipe.
1/14/2017,5,This chicken was moist and juicy.   I will make again.  Whole family loved it.
1/13/2017,5,We make this as the recipe calls for and it is delicious we never have any leftovers!
1/11/2017,5,Family loved it. Yes we will make it again.
1/9/2017,5,I would not change a thing about this recipe. Absolutely delicious!
1/9/2017,5,As usual an amazing recipe from Chef John!  The chicken sauce cheese ratio was perfect! Will make this one over and over again! ??????
1/7/2017,5,Awesome!  Made it for my discerning family and they all loved it first time!
1/5/2017,5,Excellent and will make again!
1/5/2017,5,"Easy and excellent! 4 cups of Panko Bread crumbs was too much. 1 1/2 cups of panko and 1/2 cup of parm was perfect!

Juicy crispy and great! I didn't cook with the tomato sauce just added pasta..."
1/5/2017,5,Awesome will surely make it again.
1/4/2017,5,Made exactly. I did not have time to make his sauce so used bottle sauce. Next time I will make his sauce because it looked so good. Tasted like a pro made it. Pleasantly surprised!
1/4/2017,5,No it was delicious as is!
1/3/2017,5,This has to be the best chicken Parmesan recipe that I have found. The chicken tasted wonderful and not a lot of sauce. Some in my family don't like sauce much and this was perfect if a lot of s...
1/1/2017,5,"This was just so good better than at any restaurant! 
I did follow all the directions with the exception that I made my own tomato sauce - it was definitely worth the effort! And I used about 2..."
12/14/2016,5,Great just the way it is.....
12/13/2016,5,Chef John never disappoints!  The only thing I did different was the flour - I added a packet of ranch dressing dry mix to the flour and actually patted it on the chicken before the egg mixture....
12/13/2016,5,Will definitely make again.  I did use some seasoned  bread crumbs along with panko.  Fresh basil really made it seem  restaurant quality.
12/11/2016,5,this was the best chicken parm my fiance and I ever had I wouldn't change a thing in this recipe IT WAS PERFECT!!!
12/11/2016,5,I made this for my a dinner party and everyone raved. I used Emeril's marinara sauce and whole slices of provolone. It was delicious.
12/9/2016,5,I made a few changes. I used Italian bread crumbs rather than panko because it's already seasoned.  I mixed 1/2 of the parmesan and 1/2 of the Italian bread crumbs in equal parts. I don't measur...
12/8/2016,5,the chicken I used I purchased from Aldi's and was already marinated in garlic & herbs.  I made a double batch since there are many steps and its very well worth it...This is a keeper recipe
12/5/2016,5,"Chef John THANK YOU !!!
I just made this tonight.  I prepared 6 halves  omitted the provolone and extra Parmesan for health needs.  I was out of fresh Basil and a dry Sweet Basil worked great...."
11/21/2016,5,This is the best recipe and my husband LOVED it! Easy to follow even for someone like me that doesn't cook often.
11/21/2016,5,Delicious  Wouldn't change anything.  Easy and fast too.
11/21/2016,5,"WOW!  This is restaurant-quality.  I think using two kinds of cheese really added something.

I made it with no changes.  Used my amazing home-made sauce.  :)

One note:  by the time the interna..."
11/20/2016,5,This recipe was as good as if not better than most restaurants!  Slightly crispy on the outside and moist and juicy on the inside.  This will definitely be an absolute favourite with my family.
11/17/2016,5,This was awesome. I didn't have the provolone so just omitted it. Used Prego for the prepared tomato sauce and dried basil because I didn't have fresh. I also served this on a bed of spaghetti s...
11/17/2016,5,I used spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce. I didn't use as much bread crumbs as called for.  I followed the rest of instructions as written. The end result was fabulous! Everybody raved abo...
11/16/2016,5,My family loved this recipe! The chicken stays crispy and is so tender. This made it to the weekly rotation! Delicious.
11/16/2016,5,I give it 10 out of 10! Easy recipe and it has a great taste.  I recommend! Highly recommend!
11/15/2016,5,Used italian flavored bread crumbs no basil spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce.
11/14/2016,5,Gluten free:  Use Ians GF Panko bread crumbs.  Mixed one package Italian seasoned and one package regular.  Ians makes the best GF bread Panko bread crumbs.
11/12/2016,5,Turned out great. Kids loves it and leftovers were great the next day.
11/12/2016,5,Made pretty much as is excellent recipe!

10/25/2016,5,Perfect everytime.
10/24/2016,5,One change I made is putting half the cheese on initially baking for 10 minutes and then putting the other half on.  Resulted in more gooey cheese.
10/24/2016,5,Yes I will make it again. I substituted Angelic Sprouted Wheat bread crumbs. I saved an extra pan by preheating the Corning Ware with olive oil and put the chicken tenderloins in that then in ...
10/23/2016,5,Family loves it!
10/22/2016,5,It was so good my in-laws and my husband loved it.  They are very conservative eaters no new recipes allowed. LOL So we ate it as a chicken dish with broccoli on the side no tomato sauce or s...
10/20/2016,5,It was terrific.  No changes and it was enjoyed by all.  A definite keeper!
10/19/2016,5,Very tasty.  No changes to the suggested recipe. Maybe a little less bread crumbs next time
10/17/2016,5,Yummy and easy recipe!!
10/12/2016,5,I didn't have Panko at home so I used Italian bread crumbs instead and added a little garlic powder to the mixture.. The chicken was great and my kids loved it! I'll be making this one again.
10/12/2016,5,This was wonderful!  I made it for my son for his birthday dinner and everyone loved it.  I used gluten-free Italian panko bread crumbs and didn't have any fresh basil on hand so I used dried b...
10/10/2016,5,Best meal I've made by far
10/8/2016,5,I absolutely LOVED this recipe and will make it all the time.  I did cut back on the panko to only  1.5 cups apposed to 4 cups and only used about 1/4 of the oil.
10/7/2016,5,This recipe was great I added a little bit more seasoning to the chicken. I think that 4 cups of bread crumbs are too much nest time I'll reduce it to 2 cups.
10/5/2016,5,I called this pizza chicken for my picky kids and they all loved it! AWESOME!
10/5/2016,5,I made this exactly as written (except I used Italian panko crumbs) and it was perfection. Hubby loved it too. Will be making this again!

10/4/2016,5,I made this exactly as directed and it was Amazing!!!! My hubby loved it!!!!
10/3/2016,5,This was delicious.  I didn't flour the chicken and left out the basil but the panko breadcrumbs were nice and crispy.  The whole family loved it!
10/1/2016,5,"My family loved it. Remarked how juicy it was.
I will surely make this again. Good next day."
9/29/2016,5,My husband made this for me for our anniversary and it was fantastic..  We will make this again..
9/26/2016,5,The only change we made was to use less oil to cook and different cheese. We used what we had on hand. Agario and another one I can't remember at the moment. It was a family favourite.
9/25/2016,5,Delicious! I just wouldn't use 4 cups of bread crumbs next time because I didn't even use half.
9/23/2016,5,"Chef John ROCKS!!!

We love it!"
9/21/2016,5,OMG says it all.  Made exactly to specifications.  The thick creamy mozzarella put it over the top.

5/2/2016,5,"My husband and friends absolutely love this chicken Parmesan ! 
I did not change anything ."

4/27/2016,5,The absolute best.  I used homemade classic tomato sauce and only spooned a small amount on the chicken to ensure it stayed crispy.  Used the rest with spaghetti.  yummo
4/25/2016,5,Terrific recipe!
4/25/2016,5,It's one of our favorites. There are a LOT of breadcrumbs left after you bread the chicken however. I hate wasting food so once the chicken was transferred to the baking dish I threw the leftove...

4/12/2016,5,Amazing - entire family loved it!  Didn't have provolone so used grated asiago instead.  Thank you!

3/23/2016,5,Made it doe the second time and never changed anything except I did not fry just put it in the oven and cooked it longer Great recipe for watching weight.
3/19/2016,5,Chicken Parmesan is my husband's favorite meal at Olive Garden. I wanted to make it at home. My husband said it was better than olive garden. I took the advice of others and added seasonings to ...

3/2/2016,5,My husband and I loved it!. The only change I made was using only 2 cups of planko (homemade) and 1/4 c of Parmesan for the breading and about 1/4c olive oil in the skillet. I did use a premium ...

2/24/2016,5,I like a little more sauce so I put it on a bed of spaghetti with marinara sauce.  Delicious!  Kudos to Chef John!
2/22/2016,5,Best chicken parm ever !!!
2/21/2016,5,I made this meal using RebeccaD's suggestion and it turned out great and used just enough of everything. For 10 chicken halves I only needed 4 eggs and 2 cups of Panko bread crumbs and 1/2 cup o...
2/19/2016,5,I kind of messed up making the recipe but it still came out great. I also cooked everything in one pan (cast iron). The panko crumbs give the chicken a nice crust. My husband appreciated having...
2/18/2016,5,YUM!! The only things I changed were that I used Italian bread crumbs instead of Panko (better flavor) made my own sauce and put spaghetti in the bottom of the baking dish with some sauce and c...
2/17/2016,5,Family loved it.  My only comment which I can't believe wasn't   mentioned before is inconsistency in directions. First 2 cups of panko crumbs is more than enough. I added seasoned crumbs bec...

2/4/2016,5,This recipe makes me feel like a true chef. My husband raves about the chicken. The method for breading the chicken works so well and I don't have problems with it not sticking.  I make my own b...
2/3/2016,5,I didn't have any panko so I had to use cornmeal. I used all the cheeses for my husband's and I used nondairy cheeses for mine. My husband loved his! Mine was delicious as well. We served ours o...
1/31/2016,5,Simply marvelous. Thanks for sharing!
1/30/2016,5,Chicken Parm you taste so good!  Don't forget to buy the pasta. It wasn't listed in the ingredients. The other 2/3 of tomato sauce goes over the pasta. I used a fancy tomato sauce because the fl...
1/29/2016,5,This was terrific. Chef John I love how you make things simple for the home cook. The only things I changed was I used my own spaghetti sauce and added garlic. This can be decreased to two brea...

1/25/2016,5,The very best  EVER!

1/22/2016,5,Delicious recipe the chicken was tender and delicious.  Only used 1-2 tbsps of olive oil to brown my chicken and it was plenty.
1/21/2016,5,It was a huge hit at a family gathering. I did change the recipe slightly using gluten free bread crumbs and gluten free flour. It didn't stick quite as well to the chicken breast and it wasn't...
1/21/2016,5,This was soooo good! My boyfriend said it was the best thing I've ever made. It tasted better than any chicken parm I've ordered in a restaurant. I omitted the provolone cheese only because I d...
1/21/2016,5,This turned out perfectly! So delicious and the method of breading/frying could be used for any meat.
1/20/2016,5,This changed my opinion of chicken parm. My butcher sells thin cut chicken breast cutlets so I use those rather than pounding beast halves. otherwise I follow the recipe to the letter. Fantast...
1/18/2016,5,Probably the best Chicken Parm I've ever made! I prefer Panko breadcrumbs over regular ones and I seasoned them with 2 Tablespoons Italian seasoning.
1/18/2016,5,I followed the directions mostly but I added basic seasoning to my bread crumbs other than that I went by the recipe 100% and the results were amazing I made it about 5 months ago and my guests ...

1/12/2016,5,Fantastic Recipe!!! After reading the reviews the only thing I did not do is flouring the chicken before dipping it in egg. This dish came out so delicious and cheesy. I am sure it was over a th...

1/12/2016,5,Yummy!

1/3/2016,5,Delicious! Easy to follow. This was my first time making chicken parmesean and my husband and I loved it!
12/31/2015,5,Delicious but definitely did not require 4 cups of breadcrumbs. I ended up throwing half of the breadcrumbs away. Make the recipe as is with 2 cups of breadcrumbs and it'll be just as delicious!...
12/23/2015,5,I made this for dinner last night and OMG it was yummy !!  My boyfriend took one bite and said WOW this is delicious. Said better than any upscale restaurant ever ! I followed the recipe pretty ...

12/6/2015,5,Easy & excellent!
12/6/2015,5,Keep the recipe as is. Chef John nailed it. My only suggestion is to half the breadcrumbs/panko. I barely used two cups of the four cups it called for. Other than that I baked mine on a wire ra...
12/4/2015,5,I made half a recipe and just used as much as I needed to make the recipe. It was delicious. The chicken was crunchy and moist. While I was eating it I kept thinking who can I make this for. I...

11/22/2015,5,This was delicious! I used seasoned bread crumbs and for my husband I added seasoning to his gluten free bread crumbs. I used jarred sauce because I had some I needed to use up and it was really...
11/22/2015,5,We love this.  I think that we have used pesto instead of fresh basil because we had it on hand.  The chicken parm rivals any restaurant  dis.
11/22/2015,5,I enjoyed this recipe. I had to make a change in the amount of panko. I only used 2 cups of panko which was more than enough.  And of course reducing the amount of parmesan. I breaded 8 breast ...
11/22/2015,5,I love this recipe just the way it is!
11/21/2015,5,I made with 8 chicken cutlets. I used about 1 cup and 1/2  pankos since I ran out and used 1 and 1/2 cup bread crumbs ended up with a lot left over.  I used the exact amount of oil but next day ...
11/18/2015,5,Absolutely delicious & really easy to put together! I was surprised at how easily I was able to get this made. The only change I'll make next time is adding more seasoning into the breading as w...

11/17/2015,5,I really enjoyed this recipe.  I used a smoked provolone and it was delicious with all of the other flavors.  My family and friends loved it too!  (We live in an area where it is difficult to fi...

11/10/2015,5,I have been trying to find the perfect chicken parm and I have to say this is about it! The trick is definitely pan frying it first before putting into the oven. I only had Italian style bre...
11/10/2015,5,Absolutely amazing and followed the recipe to a T!  Paired with Cesar salad and garlic bread.  The fam couldn't stop raving about it!
11/9/2015,5,Great dish!!  Don't cook the chicken before baking with spinach and mushrooms.  It will be dry.  I sautéed the spinach and mushrooms before and then drained the liquid that came out before plac...

11/4/2015,5,This is the first dish in a long time that my family demanded I add to the biweekly rotation. I forgot to buy mozzarella at the store and it was still a hit. (Just put a bit extra parmesan on t...
11/4/2015,5,I've made this twice and my family and extended family have loved it!!
11/2/2015,5,I followed the recipe except I  didn't add any sauce until the chicken was done.  I wanted the chicken crust to remain crispy.  It did!  This was very tasty to me although I must admit this is m...

10/19/2015,5,So easy and delicious. Followed the recipe exactly and it was probably one of the parms I've made. Love the crispness. Thank you
10/17/2015,5,Amazing! Tastes just like the chicken Parmesan from corner pizza joints back in Philly. Used a slice of provolone instead of shredded but otherwise followed the recipe closely. Loved it!
10/17/2015,5,I live it and have done it a few times and it's delicious. Just a little question though. For the pasta sauce which one would be ideal to use? Marinara garlic and herbs.... like what I'm askin...

9/21/2015,5,This recipe worked out perfectly!  I cooked two large breasts for myself and my husband.  I wouldn't change anything and can't wait to make it again
9/21/2015,5,I made this almost exactly the only change - I made my own sauce and so seasoned it to my liking.  It does yield a small amount of sauce to chicken but he mentions it in the description.  So...

9/17/2015,5,I LOVED this recipe! The chicken was tender and juicy and had the perfect amount of crunch! I didn't add so much Parmesan cheese only because I didn't have a lot at the time.  Also I only used...
9/16/2015,5,Surprisingly delicious!!

9/2/2015,5,I added some garlic powder and oregano to the bread crumbs. Sometimes we skip the sauce and cheese on top; it turns out really good too. Family favorite!

11/23/2014,5,I used my veggie spaghetti sauce with it.  Made sure I had extra in a pot on the stove.  Served it over spaghetti squash instead of pasta.  Very delicious.
11/22/2014,5,Very good recipe! I used tomato and basil pasta sauce because I didn't have any tomato sauce. My husband is not a fan of chicken breast but truly loved this dish!
11/22/2014,5,That was really really good.  It took me about 1.5 hours but it was delicious.  I used chicken tenders from Costco and pounded them a bit and I used half panko  and half cornflake crumbs.

11/18/2014,5,I made this exactly as written. It is by far the best chicken parm I ever had! The key is the 3 different cheeses and only using 1/3 cup of sauce per chicken breast. Thank you Chef John.

10/17/2013,5,I have found that when I don't have the fresh herbs called for use 1/2 half of dried herb. It works well but obviously fresh is always better.

2/12/2012,5,The combination of tastes in this recipe is quite good driven by the balsamic vinegar.

1/23/2012,5,This is a great base recipe and allows room for tweaking. I added a variety of different squashes and root veggies.
1/22/2012,5,Really delicious! I also recommend roasting the potatoes for awhile before adding the rest of the veggies. I used red potatoes which were really tasty.
1/21/2012,5,Loved these! My family loved these as well!
1/19/2012,5,Excellent dish!  I used sweet onions (instead of red-I don't like the texture of roasted red onions) and a yam (instead of a sweet potato which gave more color and sweetness).  I cut all of my ...

1/9/2012,5,These are delicious.  I love using the fresh herbs.  With the high heat I do watch them pretty closely after 20-25 minutes - I cut all the vegetables into bite sized pieces and they cook a littl...
1/8/2012,5,Used yellow squash instead of butternut used dry spices instead of fresh and added carrots. It was amaze-good. The hubby and kids all went back for seconds.
1/8/2012,5,LOVE these! I used less Rosemary and used broccoli heads yellow & green zuchini baby bella mushrooms red onions & red & green peppers... it is the PERFECT mix of veggies!!! They are delicious...
1/7/2012,5,The fresh rosemary is a must!  Absolutely makes the dish.  This recipe is a new favorite for me.

12/26/2011,5,This went perfect with our ham for Christmas!  I had to use dry thyme because the store was out.  We loved this!  Thanks!
12/25/2011,5,This was excellent and a huge hit at Christmas dinner! The only change I made was using a green pepper rather than red since the red peppers at my store were terrible looking. I will absolutely...

12/17/2011,5,Delicious
12/17/2011,5,I followed the directions and put in oven at 450.  Delicious!  Only had dried rosemary still great!  This is so simple I will make it over and over.

12/7/2011,5,Excellent vegetarian dish but high in carbs.
12/4/2011,5,Beautiful recipe.  I made it with fresh herbs as well as dried and the fresh is tastier I will admit.  The balsamic vinegar makes a big difference and I think sets it apart.
12/3/2011,5,This was sooo good!
11/30/2011,5,Totally delicious!  I skipped the sweet potato & added an extra yukon gold instead.  Really easy to prepare and  great winter dish when you are entertaining guests!

11/29/2011,5,I was a little sad to see that the first review had such a low review.  I used dried thyme and rosemary both and I thought it was great!  I just adjusted because dried is much more intense and c...

11/8/2011,5,This recipe was fantastic! I didn't have any red onions so I used a yellow and I added celery. My husband who doesn't even like sweet potatoes or winter squash LOVED IT! We had a lot of left ove...

10/1/2011,5,OMG...I just made this (I literally took it out of the oven a couple of minutes ago) and I can't stop 'tasting' it.  The herb/balsamic/olive oil mix enhances the sweetness of the vegetables.  It...
9/30/2011,5,Very good for a different taste to grilled veggies.
9/29/2011,5,Incredible.  I added a few more drizzles of EVOO during the roasting process but this was so good.  I also added a few mushrooms too.  Better the second day after marinating in that dressing...

5/15/2011,5,I have made these several times-absolutely delicious. I am always looking for new veg recipes and this is great. My favorite is the sweet potatoes. I always add extra!
5/3/2011,5,I think I have died and gone to heaven!  What an excellent choice of seasonings and the balsamic vienegar was an incredible addition.  I did use white balsamic to avoid discoloring the vegies w...

11/1/2002,5,This was just wonderful.  I served to company and they raved.  The colors are so pretty too.  This is listed under Christmas recipes but I think it's a neat fall recipe too.  I gobbled up all t...
10/12/2002,5,this was sooo delicious.  the vegetables were perfect.  i made some alteration and it was great. the secret of this recipe is the sauce and the fresh herbs.  you will love it if you try it.
9/24/2002,5,THe best!!! The sweet potatoes ( i use yams) really make the recipe. We enjoy this often during the winter...at least once a week.
9/4/2002,5,Saundra...this recipe for roasted vegetables is awesome!!!  It was very easy to make and absolutely delicious.  The combination of the sweetness of the red peppers and the squash potatoes etc....
9/3/2002,5,This is definitely a great veggie side dish! I made it for a dinner party and it was a hit! You can't go wrong if you follow all the instructions exactly. Using a shallow roasting pan is a must...
7/30/2002,5,Easy and absolutely delicious--and this coming from a person who normally doesn't eat vegetables.  I did even more substitutions by using Italian & yellow squash instead of butternut.  This is d...
7/26/2002,5,Easy to do and excellent combination
5/13/2002,5,I made this exactly to the recipe (with the exception of acorn squash) and it was delicious.  Lots of chopping but easy and a great way to have a vege dish.  Needs lots of stirring and maybe ...
4/4/2002,5,We all loved this recipe!  Versions of this recipe using the vegetables that are hand are easy now that I know the basics but the combination on veggies used was very tasty!  I liked how it can...

1/14/2002,5,I made this for christmas dinner It was fantastic.
12/25/2001,5,My mouth was watering when it was roasting in the oven.  I omitted some vegetables and added others.  This recipe can be used with any seasonal vegetables.  The dressing makes the dish.  Delicio...
12/19/2001,5,These came out great. I used sweet potatoes instead of white potatoes. The whole dish was fragrant and sweet.
12/15/2001,5,I used acorn squash and the dish was delicious! Be careful cutting and peeling the squash!
12/6/2001,5,This smelled so good while cooking ... I think the temperature is a little high - mine burned - I'm going to make it again and lower the temp to 375.  Very tasty!
11/15/2001,5,It was delicious when we made it and ate it and even more delicious as left overs.  I don't think you need the yukon gold potatoes I found it to be fine without it.  Thanks for a great recipe!
11/6/2001,5,It's always nice to have a different way to do fresh vegetables.
6/5/2001,5,Very good!  I tried to reduce the amount of veggies in half but found you should still use the same amount of seasonings and oil.  Added green pepper and more red onion.
5/4/2001,5,It is time-consuming but well worth it.  Scale it down a little... the recipe makes a TON!
3/18/2001,5,Great recipe...easy to make and delicious!!
12/31/2000,5,a big hit we will have them again but add more thyme

10/22/2017,5,Very easy tasty recipe! Definitely added to our list of favorites!

9/18/2017,5,We really enjoyed these I made as directed and lined the pan with foil for easy clean up. Will make these again.
8/24/2017,5,I used Yukon Gold potatoes rather than red. This recipe was delicious - I made as the directions stated no changes and I only had to bake 35 minutes to perfect potatoes. These will be a staple ...
7/26/2017,5,This was a fantastic recipe!  The entire family enjoyed eating this dish and I am so glad that I made extra servings.  This dish will certainly be in the family rotation of meals.  Thank you for...
6/4/2017,5,These were so good.  I double the sauce and baked them in a dish on the grill.  Delicious.
5/27/2017,5,Very flavorful but I'm going to re make them. I did them own the  crock pot. I can see why the recipe calls for them to be cooked in the oven.
5/12/2017,5,This was tasty and very popular with my family members.  In addition it is extremely easy to make even down to only having to quarter the potatoes and leaving the skins on.  Be careful while b...
4/27/2017,5,I used golden potatoes instead of red as that was what I had on hand. Looked gorgeous and tasted even better! Following the suggestion from other reviews I did boil the potatoes before baking t...
4/7/2017,5,These are very good potatoes! My boyfriend loved them. I boiled the potatoes for about five minutes as suggested in a previous review. They turned out very crisp and full of flavor.
3/29/2017,5,This was a good base recipe that I tweaked to work with the Maple-Garlic Marinated Pork Tenderloin recipe. If you microwave the potatoes for two minutes they will be cooked in 45 minutes at ...
3/23/2017,5,Delicious and easy. I did bake for45 minutes.
3/15/2017,5,I'm a sucker for potatoes and these are delicious! They bake to the perfect consistency and the honey gives it a sweet flavour that compliments the entire dish. Super easy to make!
2/8/2017,5,Did very little to change. Did cayenne pepper instead of mustard. Added lots of cut up red pepper and purple onions. Baked in oven with Titanium pot. No sticking and turned out perfect. Loved th...
1/9/2017,5,was all gone.  even the teenager loved it!  I didn't have dry mustard but just tossed the melted butter and honey with some dijon mustard.  mid way through roasting I tossed them up with a lit...

12/9/2016,5,Family loved it in my recipe box forever
11/22/2016,5,Tasted great just added garlic.  I love to use garlic when I cook.
11/21/2016,5,"The only change made was to add an additional tsp of butter and 1 tsp of honey (I'm a sucker for sweet and buttery stuff).
Tasted great; will definitely make it again."
11/20/2016,5,Simple and great tasting.
11/20/2016,5,This recipe is really good. My family loved it. Next time I will increase the honey and butter a bit more and add a little extra salt. I think the seasoning depends upon how many potatoes one us...
11/14/2016,5,Yes I add some garlic.  Just because I love it.
9/25/2016,5,I absolutely loved these! I added extra honey just due to my own personal preferences they were sweet and golden a perfect side dish!
9/21/2016,5,My husband isn't a potato man and loved them. Easy and flavorful.
9/3/2016,5,These potatoes are fantastic!  I love the sweetness the honey adds.  My new favorite roasted potatoes.  They do take a while to cook-as another reviewer mentioned about 40-60 minutes but it's wo...
8/30/2016,5,I've made these before for my boyfriend and a few friends. They loved them so when I saw this recipe I was delighted. I am currently making them now. I did not use the onions this time. (I'm sic...
7/13/2016,5,We absolutely love this recipe. We do have to bake the potatoes for about 15 minutes longer than the recipe says but other than that this turns out perfect just as written.
6/12/2016,5,Made this recently. I didn't have dry mustard so I just omitted that. It was still delicious. the honey adds such a mildly sweet flavor and a pinch of salt offsets it. Deserves 5 stars for sure.
6/11/2016,5,I have already made this about 1000 times. This is definitely one of the BEST recipes for roasted potatoes EVER!!!!!!! Loooooove it!!!!!!!!!!
5/15/2016,5,Very tasty and easy to make.
5/7/2016,5,Husband really liked these. I didn't change a thing but my quartered red potatoes must have been extra large as it took almost an hour to cook. I would add more salt and pepper next time too but...
5/2/2016,5,Amazing! The only tweak I made was substituting olive oil for the butter.
4/11/2016,5,love it! will make again!
4/6/2016,5,These potatoes are exceptional! I used baby golds because I had some leftover and left out the onion. I also increased honey to 3T and baked for 40 minutes. Make sure to stir a few times while c...
4/3/2016,5,Def making again
3/19/2016,5,Will definately make again.  Used recipe as written except thin sliced potatoes instead of using quarter cuts.
1/17/2016,5,I have been making this recipe for years and it is absolutely delicious!  I use yellow mustard instead of the dry mustard and I use more of the honey mustard combination than the recipe calls fo...
1/1/2016,5,Made this as a side for a small New Year's Ever get together. Just be careful if you are cooking on a convection setting. The honey can burn to the pan very quickly. That's my fault though. Not ...
12/15/2015,5,This is a quick and easy side dish to go with meat dishes.  My entire family loves these potatoes and I make a double batch when I make them.  Everyone keeps going back for seconds and then thir...
12/8/2015,5,These are a regular family favorite - but I always make a few changes .  I double the sauce and oil boil the red potatoes for a few minutes before or else the cooking time Is way more.  Love the...
12/2/2015,5,i forgot to add the mustard powder and added some fresh rosemary
10/12/2015,5,It's helpful to put the honey and melted butter in a gallon sized freezer bag with the potatoes so you can shake them around and get them coated really well.
10/3/2015,5,These potatoes were delicious!  I am going to make it one of my regulars.
8/22/2015,5,On a picnic buffet table full of many potluck dishes this simple but delicious and healthier potato dish option had all the guests asking for the recipe.
8/16/2015,5,I will absolutely make this again though next time I'll double it so I can have leftovers for lunch the next day.
7/18/2015,5,"Fantastic recipe!

5/17/2015,5,Used regular mustard because I forgot the dry and it still came out delish. #Recipebox
1/28/2015,5,Love love love this recipe! I usually double the sauce. The original amount didn't seem to be enough for all of the potatoes.
1/16/2015,5,Very good and simple!
11/28/2014,5,Made this recipe with only one small change - I used onion powder instead of real onions (I'm not much for the texture) and they turned out amazing. We did have too cook them for a bit longer th...
11/10/2014,5,This is a terrific and easy side dish. Probably needs about 1/2 again as much sauce as called for.  I also used seasoning pepper and probably close to a teaspoon full to amp these up a bit.  Sec...
11/6/2014,5,These potatoes were so good!!! I added a bit more honey. I would say according to your taste and how many potatoes you use. However this recipe gives you a great base to start with! Yummy must t...

7/9/2014,5,These are fantastic! Everyone loved them and asked when I was going to make them again. This is a keeper!
7/6/2014,5,I doubled the honey and dry mustard and it tasted fantastic! Depending on the size of your potatoes you may need to cook them for a bit longer.
7/5/2014,5,I used fingerling potatoes and boiled them a bit first. I cooked them on a cookie sheet and moved them around a couple times during cooking. After 1/2 hour I turned up the temp to 400 because th...

4/26/2014,5,really sweet and yummy!
3/16/2014,5,Yum! I found the addictive taste of these potatoes snuck up on me. My first bite or so I thought meh these are ok a little too sweet. A few bites later I thought you know these are pretty ...

3/3/2014,5,These were out of this world.  I will definitely make these again.  Just a piece of advice if you don't like onions and are looking to not use them don't bother with the recipe.  The onions ar...

2/18/2014,5,My new go-to recipe for roasted potatoes!
2/16/2014,5,Quick easy and delicious potatoes!  I fixed 'Honey Glazed Pork Tenderloin' and these potatoes went nicely with the meat.  I made a batch and a half so that we would have leftovers.  I didn't ha...
2/14/2014,5,We substituted olive oil for the butter and added julienned red bell peppers on top.  The red peppers and honey created a great flavor!
2/10/2014,5,I doubled the sauce cause we like thing saucey.  It was a huge it at my dinner party this weekend.  The guys kept walking back into the kitchen to pinch a potato.
1/21/2014,5,Just the right amount of sweetness!
1/13/2014,5,Wonderful twist on roasted potatoes! Followed exact but did pour in a tad more honey since it looked dry but without the extra it would have still been a hit with even the little ones!
12/27/2013,5,Hubby loved these but he loves things that are sweet... they were very good.
12/25/2013,5,Delicious and easy to make!
12/10/2013,5,loved it....wud make them again!
11/28/2013,5,This recipe was simple and easy to make. The honey adds a mild sweetness but nothing overwhelming. I made the recipe exactly as stated and it turned out great. I will be making this again.
11/21/2013,5,Awesome! Didn't use horseradish added onion powder.
11/12/2013,5,My family loved this. I just made it 2 weeks ago and am making it again already.
11/2/2013,5,Absolutely delicious.  This is a new family staple.  They crisp up nicely and just a hint of sweet make them perfect.

6/26/2013,5,Really great stuff! If you don't have dry mustard you can always substitute prepared mustard (Dijon works best) *the ratio being 1 tablespoon prepared for every 1 teaspoon dry
5/19/2013,5,Just WOW!!! Thanks!
5/13/2013,5,We all loved this dish and kept on eating leftovers all week. Looking forward to make this again soon. (I used reg mustard since I had no dry mustard).
5/1/2013,5,Very good!  :)
3/24/2013,5,Wonderful! The only thing I did differently was to slice a small onion and break it into rings rather than using the diced onion called for. My guest and I both felt that the onion made the dish.
3/20/2013,5,Husband said give it a five so here it is. I would use foil under the potatoes and also mix them up once during the cooking or coat them in a bowl before you put them on the pan.
3/9/2013,5,Read many reviews of this recipe. Also has been frequently recommended on the buzz now I know why. It is so good. The honey is not overpowering. I used at least 1 1/2 lb. of red potatoes incre...

3/8/2013,5,Phenomenal!  I made these 2 days in a row.  I used 3Tbsp. honey and 3Tbsp. butter.  I did need to bake them about an hour.  Also I cut the potatoes in half and then each half into quarters.  Th...

2/23/2013,5,Another dish that has made me a hit with my family. Love it.
2/20/2013,5,Great jumping off point that can easily go up to five stars with a few adjustments. After reading the reviews I decided to increase the sauce. I used about 6 TB olive oil instead of butter &...
2/12/2013,5,Yummy. This is a great taste. It made the potatoes taste a bit sweet but not too much. This was a hit in m y house and we will be using this again.
2/10/2013,5,"Initially microwaved the potatoes then finished them in the oven.

1/27/2013,5,Yum! I didn't have any onions and I had no idea what dry mustard was so I just made honey butter pepper potatoes and they were the best part of the meal!
12/22/2012,5,"this was very very good.  I put in 4 T melted butter 4 T honey 2 t. dry mustard 4 S seasoning Northwoods Fire for our family amount of potatoes.
I also put in lots of frozen diced onions."
11/4/2012,5,So today I was trying to find a different potato recipe because my man is a meat and potato's kind of guy and I can only handle mashed potato's so many times. I tried this recipe and I am so hap...
10/30/2012,5,My new go-to roasted potato recipe.  To add flavor I use a whole onion all the above mentioned ingredients and some Tony's seasoning.  Very easy and very flavorful.
9/28/2012,5,Spray the foil.  The mess sticks.

8/11/2012,5,i luv this! Super easy to make and with little time to prep!
8/6/2012,5,My family enjoyed this recipe! The potatoes had a nice mellow sweet flavour. A nice change from the herb potatoes we always have.

3/21/2012,5,used agave instead of honey and these were great!
3/18/2012,5,Easy requires no tweaking tasty and a really good side dish for just about anything.  If you feel like being fancy you can add other things as well but it totally doesn't need it.
2/22/2012,5,Awesome! I sprinkled salt on the potatoes before putting on the honey mixture and I used 3 tablespoons of honey. Everything else was done as written...super easy to make and it wasn't too much ...
2/22/2012,5,Didn't have any dry mustard so I just left it out. Very good way to add a slight sweetness to potatoes!

12/27/2011,5,Very good!!! Cooking time was longer then written but I will use this again:)
12/3/2011,5,I was skeptical about these potatoes but indeed delicious as everyone says! I used shortening as the grease instead of butter onion powder dijon mustard honey and just kept stirring.
12/1/2011,5,Perfect recipe made with exact ingredients.  Cooked for 35 mins.
11/18/2011,5,I added some oil to the honey mixture before coating and also added LOTS more honey than just 1 Tablespoon. They are SO yummy I have been making them often!
11/15/2011,5,This is awesome!!!  I made more glaze to drizzle on top though.  Super delish!
10/23/2011,5,double the sauce and cook 1 hour and put under broiler last 5-10-min.
10/17/2011,5,Great recipe! Cooked it for a few people & they all loved it & even asked for the recipe! It has the perfect amount of sweetness to it (the honey). Will make again.
10/14/2011,5,So very easy and yet such GREAT taste! My entire family loved these. This is a definite keeper and also one that I will be sharing with my friends.

10/1/2011,5,This is also extremely tasty when you substitute Grade B Maple Syrup for the honey.  The reason for the grade B is that it has a stronger maple flavor as well as a boat load more nutrients.  Enj...

8/17/2011,5,Fantastic!  I baked at 350 for 45 min because I had another dish that required that temp.  Nice carmelization!  Delicious.  Will make again possibly with more of the sauce.
8/17/2011,5,this is a wonderful recipe. I was looking for something different to do with the potatoes and this was perfect.my girls actually asked for seconds which never happens.
8/16/2011,5,Great! I did use more honey (about 2.5T) 1T prepared mustard since I didn't have dry and I sprinkled the salt and pepper over all of the potatoes.
8/14/2011,5,So delish! Something different which was much needed! Will make again!
8/14/2011,5,Absolutely delicious made these today & will definitely make the again.

7/18/2011,5,Cooked longer to get them more crisp.  Sauce carmalized and kids got to scrap it's goey thickness off roasting pan! Delicious!
7/14/2011,5,Fun to make something different.  My 5 year old loved it too.  My husband took a pause & said It's slightly sweet but really good.  You'll have to make these again.  I only added a little mor...
7/12/2011,5,"I only had a little bit of honey.. so I added more butter.. I also added lots of garlic...

7/6/2011,5,To Stephndon; Good recipe as is! Thank you :)
7/2/2011,5,I love roasted red potatoes in just about every way but my husband prefers a good old fashioned baked russet. I've been trying to find a recipe he'll tolerate without whining. I made these to g...
6/23/2011,5,These were delicious!  Doubled the recipe baked for about 45 min broiling the last 5.  Will definitely make again when the kitchen is overrun with potatoes from the garden!  :)

6/16/2011,5,I made these exactly as described and they are delicious!  I love the honey flavor!
6/14/2011,5,Wonderful flavor.  I loved the subtle flavor of honey in this dish.  As you can see by the picture I like my potatoes very well done so I did increase the baking time but that is the only chang...
6/14/2011,5,these were delicious ! thank you for a great recipe :)
6/14/2011,5,These were delicious!  I made these on the grill with my grill pan lined in foil.  I did double the honey butter mixture because I probably had more like 1.5 pounds of potatoes.  These had a gre...
6/11/2011,5,These were great.  I love how sweet the onions were.  I used purple potatoes and had to cook mine about 50 mins.
6/10/2011,5,these are the BEST! i would've never thought honey and potatoes.. but it works.. i made them for a party at work once everyone asked for the recipe.. i add extra honey and dry mustard..
6/9/2011,5,cooked them for 40 minutes stirring them up 20 min and before serving tripled the amount of honey.  added them to a candied kielbasa recipe from this site by BUCHko and added canned green beans.
6/6/2011,5,Awesome awesome awesome.  We couldn't get enough.  Definitely double or even triple the sauce.  Served this with the Rosemary Ranch Chicken Kabobs from this site...great combo!  Yum-O!
6/3/2011,5,all  ingredients were wonderful - doubled the recipe and roasted 35 minutes at 375 degrees - turned potatoes over then  raised temp to 400 and roasted an additional 10 minutes.  we love roasted ...
5/31/2011,5,awesome. Make sure you cover pan in foil. I have ruined a couple pans by not doing this.
5/24/2011,5,only change I made was to use whole grain prepared mustard instead of dry mustard. DELISH!
5/22/2011,5,The whole family enjoyed these.  We've done potatoes with oilive oil and rosemary and wanted something different.  Loved the slightly sweet to the potatoes.  Very good!
5/22/2011,5,Great potato recipe.  And easy.  I broil them for an additional 5-10 minutes to blacken them up a bit.
5/16/2011,5,Loved these potatoes.  I agree with other raters that you need to double the sauce recipe.  I made with Yukon and they came out fine!
5/14/2011,5,A friend of mine made these at a dinner we had and they were amazing everyone loved them. I now am making them for a dinner party and know they will be just a huge hit!
5/11/2011,5,Absolutely delicious. I typically make about 1.5x as much of the sauce so that it's more flavorful.
5/1/2011,5,Wow! Everyone had seconds and thirds. My toddler couldn't keep her hands out of the bowl. I cut my reds into small bite size pieces and doubled the sauce. There was just enough on it. I also put...
4/29/2011,5,Really yummy! Nice change from typical onion or Ranch roasted potatoes. Just a hint of sweetness. Very well received by all who have tasted them!
4/26/2011,5,These were really good!  I did as some other reviewers suggested and left out the butter and just used a little more honey.  I stirred them once or twice while they were cooking.  They did take ...
4/24/2011,5,I had to feed 15ppl so I made alot more than what the recipe called for.  Tip - Make extra sauce!!  The potatoes soak it up and will stick to the baking dish and fall apart if you don't.  It's ...
4/24/2011,5,Everyone loved.  I lined pan with foil and sprayed w Pam for easy clean up.  Took an hour.
4/23/2011,5,I used half a teaspoon (approx.) of spicy brown mustard instead of the dry mustard and these turned out amazing! I also followed the suggestion of another reviewer and boiled the potatoes for fi...
4/19/2011,5,Soooo good! Taste like a sweet potato in a way. I will be making this all the time! Thank you!
4/18/2011,5,I have made these about 3 times. There are never enough. People get 3rds and 4ths. I used onion powder instead of onions due to some not liking the texture. I also pulled it out a little early a...
4/17/2011,5,Everybody has already said enough about this recipe! It's the bomb!!!! Thanks!
4/17/2011,5,Yum! These were very good. I couldn't taste the mustard at all so I may increase that the next time. This recipe is a keeper for sure!
4/17/2011,5,These made for a tasty side dish for kabobs on the grill.  I tossed the sauce with the potatoes in a bowl and then poured them onto a baking sheet lined with foil and sprayed with oil.  They coo...
4/17/2011,5,I made them exactly as written.  We loved them.  I make a similar recipe out on the grill and now that I have tried them once following the directions I am anxious to try them on the grill wrap...
4/17/2011,5,My husband raved and asks for this all of the time.  I use more honey than called for but my husband likes his flavors strong.
4/16/2011,5,Very easy and an excellent compliment to almost every meal I put it with.  I do suggest using more honey then the recipe call for though.
4/16/2011,5,I followed the previous reviewers tips and doubled most of the ingredients... it was absolutely delicious. I loved it... and I hate potatoes! Thanks for the amazing recipe.
4/15/2011,5,My son is 5 and for as long as i can remember he would not eat potatoes.  So i made these and expected the same results...boy was i wrong! I told him they had honey on them and he decided to try...
4/11/2011,5,I could have ate the whole pan myself!  I had fingerling red potatoes that I cut into thirds and 35 minutes was perfect for them.  I may have overestimated my pinch of pepper because they had a ...
4/10/2011,5,Followed recipe exactly-maybe I added some extra onion- I didn't measure them.  We really liked these.  I like the sweetness.  It wasn't too much it was just right.  We love potatoes and like m...

4/7/2011,5,These are wonderful. To speed up baking time i partially cooked these in the microwave first for a few minutes then cut them up. I think the sauce absorbed into the potatoes doing it this way a...
3/29/2011,5,Amazed at how yummy these were.  Easy and had great flavor.  Not too overewhelming or too sweet.
3/26/2011,5,This recipe was amazing... So easy But I suggest  to double this. Made with Pork chops and gravy and My husband Loved it. Thank you for this easy go to recipe !!!
3/25/2011,5,These were delish! I cooked them in my Actifry instead of in the oven. Next time I'll use only about half the oil but no other changes will be needed. yum!
3/20/2011,5,Loved it ad have made this 3 times already. My only change is to make more of the honey mixture to really coat the potatoes. Every one loved them.

3/15/2011,5,An easy family favorite and very delicious!
3/14/2011,5,So delicious!!! My whole family (even 4 & 5 year old) loved it! There was not a single piece left. Only thing I did different is cooked it for 40 minutes with foil covering the potatoes (suggest...

2/23/2011,5,Oh my gosh!  These are so good!  I used garlic instead of onion and they were to die for!  My son loved them and the BF (who doesn't like potatoes...I know he's odd!) even liked them!  **Edit:...
2/22/2011,5,I made this last night and it was amazing! My kids don't care for potatoes but these they did like. I didn't have dry mustard so I substituted it with regular yellow mustard which you can't eve...

2/6/2011,5,everyone loves these!
1/27/2011,5,These were excellent.  I did add a little more of each ingredient for the coating to make sure everything was covered.  The recipe was perfect and they were easily the best roasted potatoes I've...
1/26/2011,5,Love these and everyone who has tasted them also enjoys them.  Before baking I boil the potatoes for five minutes as someone else suggested. I put them in a mixing bowl and toss in one package o...
1/24/2011,5,My family loves this recipe!  Served it to my in-laws and they want the recipe.  Only change I make is I used diced garlic in place of the onion.  Super good!
1/20/2011,5,This is a great company recipe.  It is simple but presents beautifully.  Next time I will increase the onions and sauce ingredients a little because they add so much to the flavor.  That way ...
1/17/2011,5,These were fantastic. We had no leftovers; next time I think I'm going to have to double the amount. Wonderful!
1/15/2011,5,Yummo!  A great side dish with stuffed chicken breasts pork chops etc.  I'm greedy so I added more butter and honey and my husband (who is a picky eater) begs me to make them.  I cook them abo...

1/11/2011,5,Good recipe and good idea. I think the longer you bake them the better them get. My family likes when they begin to brown so if you are like us give yourself 50 minutes to make these.
1/9/2011,5,I love these potatoes.  I will definitely increase the sauce for next time.  Rather than drizzle over the potatoes I toss them in the honey/butter mixture in a bowl then pour into my baking di...
1/8/2011,5,These potatoes came out just perfect! Not only were they tender and extremely flavorful but they complimented my pork chops to the T. This will definitely go into the side dish rotation!

12/8/2010,5,These were a hit! So much better than plain roasted potatoes!  I used 2 tablespoons of melted butter and 2 tablespoons of honey along with a squirt of regular mustard.  I think I might add even...
12/5/2010,5,This was hugely popular at my house.  I used the small fingerling potatoes instead of red potatoes and they were delicious!!

10/20/2010,5,I tripled the honey and added salt to all the potatoes (covering them) I had to cook them for 40 minutes and then I put them under the broiler for a few minutes to make them a little crispier
10/20/2010,5,Absolutely delicious!  My fiance and I loved this recipe.  It took longer to bake it was closer to 50 minutes but that might be because the potato chunks were larger so I recommend smaller ch...
10/14/2010,5,Delish!  This was an awesome side dish.  Loved the sweetness of the honey.  I used basil instead of rosemary and that is the only change I made.  Next time I will double the sauce. Loved it!

7/20/2010,5,My kids loved the potatoes. The honey adds a nice sweet glaze to the potatoes so that my kids didn't even use kethcup. Will make again.
7/18/2010,5,I made this recipe last night for dinner along with baby back ribs and corn on the cob. Rather than dicing an onion I was going to use onion powder in the sauce portion but forgot to add it :/...
7/10/2010,5,These were delicious. I might use a bowl or glass dish instead of a pan - my baking sheet became burnt. Otherwise it was the perfect taste.
7/10/2010,5,I tried these last night I was skeptical but they were pretty good! I did follow others advise and doubled the sauce but I messed up and put the diced onions in the sauce as well dont think i...

1/5/2010,5,The taste on these potatoes was so good! I was under a time crunch so I had to take them out slightly early but they would have been perfect had I left them in the oven for 10 more minutes.
12/29/2009,5,These were very yummy.  I knew they would take longer than I was going to have to roast them so I did boil them for just long enough to soften them ever so slightly.  I then used a large non-st...

12/22/2009,5,Soooo good!  I put some red pepper flakes in too for an extra kick.  I ended up cooking a lot longer because I was waiting on someone so they got a little mushy but even still they were a hit!  ...
12/17/2009,5,Absolutely the best.  I made this twice and the best way was on my Pampered Chef large stone bar pan.  The potatoes crisped nicely and had a beautiful color.  Small petite potatoes are best but ...

12/8/2009,5,This was excellent! Such a unique flavor! I added a little bit of garlic powder and onion powder to the butter mix. Reminded me of Christmas.
12/8/2009,5,These potatoes are exquisite! Ive never actually made them with red potatoes because I've never had them on hand. Instead i use plain old russet potatoes which work just fine. Also i substitut...
12/7/2009,5,Yum!! I love red potatoes AND honey so this was  real hit with me. Easy to prepare just plan ahead since it takes a while to roast. Thanks!
12/4/2009,5,Very good! I get perfectly cooked honey potatoes every time by microwaving the potato cubes for few minutes before putting them in the oven with the sauce.
12/1/2009,5,So amazing! I made a few changes -- I doubled the butter and the honey and only kind of eyeballed the spices so I likely doubled the mustard too! I was roasting a pork tenderloin to go with th...
11/21/2009,5,This is a nice slightly sweet side dish.  It works with russet or red potatoes and I usually cut them in quarter inch slices to speed up the cooking time a little.

8/10/2009,5,We have been looking for a good roasted potato recipe and this one is great. I used a little more honey just because we like our potatoes with a lot of flavor. I also took the suggestion of goin...

7/18/2009,5,Everyone liked them!  Followed recipe as it appeared.
7/14/2009,5,These were really good but I think they need closer to 1 hour for softer potatoes.  DEFINITELY stir them up use SPRAYED foil and maybe increase the amount of sauce.  Also thought they would be...

6/2/2004,5,I served these with a cumin flavored pork loin and my dinner party really enjoyed the hint of sweetness in the potatoes.  The recipe is perfect for spicy meat.
4/18/2004,5,I love these potatoes.  Simple enough for anyday; special enough for company.  Absolutely delicious when the dressing starts to caramelize a bit--yum!
3/28/2004,5,These are the best potatoes!  If you run out of honey you can use brown sugar for a similar effect (not quite as good).
2/16/2004,5,Wonderful flavor. I used very tiny red-purple & finger potatoes & it was fantastic.
2/12/2004,5,I always make this for company and it is always the first to go. Everyone I have made this for has loved it and it is the easiest thing to make!
2/9/2004,5,These were GREAT! If hubby knew that I had put honey in it he wouldn't have eaten these (he still doesn't know)he thought they were great I thought they were AWESOME! I did add garlic powder ex...

1. I boil the potoatoes first - just until a little more tender but still firm..."

10/30/2003,5,My family loved this.  I prepared as directed.  Allowing for the different sizes of potatoes I made sure the pieces were relatively small.  I had no trouble with the cooking time.  I consider t...
9/24/2003,5,I doubled the recipe but left the same amount of butter so it was essentially halved.  I also added some garlic powder and cayenne pepper.  I also used dijon mustard instead of the powder (same...
9/1/2003,5,Excellent recipe! Make sure you cut into little pieces; Also added a lot more dry mustard and honey. Taste it before you put it on the potatoes. If it tastes right then you are good to go. Also...
6/30/2003,5,Wonderful flavor!! I did cut the potatoes smaller and extended the cooking time for about 20 minutes. Were a definite hit with everyone.
6/8/2003,5,YUMMMMMMMMMM   EXCELLANT RECIPE
6/2/2003,5,I fixed this recipe for 6 people 2 of which were children and we all loved it.  I didn't have the dry mustard so I used regular and it turned out great I did have to bake it for about 50 minu...
5/27/2003,5,When I tried these potatoes I thought that they would end up to sweet but to my suprise they were incredibly delicious. This is a deffinate kepper!
4/30/2003,5,Delish!
4/25/2003,5,My husband LOVED these...he wanted to know if i could put them on the weekly rotation...so i guess ill need to buy more potatoes...lol thanks for sharing =)

4/6/2003,5,Good flavor! Not really that sweet just perfect.

2/8/2003,5,Although I'm not used to potatoes being sweetened this was a very pleasant flavor. It seemed the more we ate the more it kind of grew on us. Though it tasted pleasant I'm not sure if I would ...

1/13/2003,5,Outstanding Quick and EASY!!
1/7/2003,5,These potatoes were the BEST.  After reading the recipe reviews I bought the smallest red potatoes I could find and partially skinned them.  Because it looked like it took longer cooking time (...
1/5/2003,5,These potatoes are a good change from the typical roasted potatoes with just oil and dill.  I liked the sweet taste mixed with the onions.  Next time I will double the sauce cut my onions much...
1/5/2003,5,So good! If you like sweet side dishes you'll love these potatoes. I'm a potato fanatic and have tried many recipes but this is one of my all time favorites. Very greasy but worth it. Had to ba...
1/1/2003,5,These were terrific. I made a few changes to the recipe. Instead of butter I used olive oil to reduce the saturated fat.I also chopped the potatoes into smaller pieces than quarters. I  added a...
11/30/2002,5,Thes potatoes were a ahit with the whole family!  I added a little more liquid - delicious!!
11/17/2002,5,I served these potatoes with turkey at Easter.  I put them in the oven while my turkey rested.  I doubled the recipe and I still did not have any leftover!
11/14/2002,5,Thought these would be too sweet for our taste but I was SO wrong.  What flavor!  One comment...I cooked the potatoes for a full hour (at least) and they came out with nice crispy skins.  Perf...

10/3/2002,5,Wonderful taste.
9/28/2002,5,This is a really good recipe.  The potatoes have a slightly sweet flavor that went really well with apricot chicken (a recipe also from this site).  My husband absolutely loved them!
9/22/2002,5,I tripled the recipe and took these potatoes to a church dinner.  I sat next to a very good chef.  He loved them and asked for the recipe.     I followed the recipe but...mixed the potatoes an...

9/10/2002,5,Excellent potatoes.  Honey goes great with red potatoes.
9/8/2002,5,Delicious! I thought it might be too sweet but it wasn't at all. I doubled all seasonings honey butter etc. and tossed potatoes in it beforehand. Definitely needs to be cooked an hour. They...

8/30/2002,5,Great way of making potatoes. It was easy and delicious! It is even better the next day.
7/30/2002,5,This recipe was awesome!  I used two pds of potatoes and doubled the rest of my ingredients.  My husband loved the potatoes.  I served it with grilled pork chops.  Definitely a keeper!
7/3/2002,5,"This is an excellent recipe which I have made twice recently.  It was a hit at my
Father's Day brunch and again at a Canada Day dinner.  It received raves by all
my guests at both functions.  ..."
7/2/2002,5,Not to sweet and very good.
6/2/2002,5,This recipe was absolutely awesome!  Just enough sweet to make them appealing for everyone!  I will definitely be making this a regular addition to our menu!
4/10/2002,5,These potatoes have been a huge hit at every dinner I have served them! They are excellent and the honey adds just the right amount of sweetness!
3/28/2002,5,I realized I did not have the dry mustard so I substituted with garlic.  Our family one of ten loved it.  As my son said Mmmm!
2/26/2002,5,GREAT recipe! I baked for nearly an hour however & it was great. I added parsley flakes. Next time I'll use olive oil instead of butter to make it more heart healthy. This is a recipe that yo...
2/14/2002,5,This was fabulous.  The entire family loved it and it was very easy to do.
2/10/2002,5,This recipe was FABULOUS!!  I made it with parisienne potatoes instead of the red ones.  They turned out fantastic and went well with the pork dish i served.  This one is a keeper!
2/4/2002,5,I made these potatoes recently with the Caramel Apple Pork Chops also here at allrecipes.  It was a great combonation.  I followed the other poster's suggestions and increased the honey used.  I...
1/29/2002,5,This was a huge family hit.  The prep time was quick and not messy to fix.
1/14/2002,5,These were great.  My husband even asked me to save the leftovers for later!!
1/13/2002,5,Wow!!!  What a great easy side dish.  Excellent flavour...I had to double the recipe for my family and there was nothing left over. My family really loved it.  I will make this often to accompan...
12/31/2001,5,These were absolutely delicious!  Because of long experience with roasted potatoes I allowed an hour to roast and covered with foil for the first 40 minutes.  This is definately a keeper!
12/19/2001,5,These were great except that they took took longer to cook than expected.  I think that I will cover them next time with foil to creat a steamy environment!!
12/3/2001,5,These potatoes were great! Cutting up a pound of potatoes wasn't nearly enough for my family. I will definately be making this again.
11/28/2001,5,I made this to add something a little different for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it...Even the picky eaters. This is definatly one of everyone's favorites.
11/19/2001,5,This is a wonderful side dish recipe. Will make again and again.

10/10/2001,5,These were very good.  I really liked the subtle flavor and didn't think it needed any more kick.  Yummmmy!
9/15/2001,5,Great!  I quartered the potatoes and added a little extra honey dry mustard regular mustard and olive oil.  I added potatoes to the sauce and coated them rather than pooring the sauce over the ...
9/5/2001,5,To die for!  Absolutely perfect!  Super easy!  This recipe was a big hit at my house; guests and family loved it.  Served with a rotisserie chicken and green beans almandine.  Only one alteratio...
6/23/2001,5,EXCELLENT!!
6/6/2001,5,Wonderful flavor.  I added a little olive oil and used both a little of the dry mustard and a little yellow mustard.  Super recipe.
4/30/2001,5,This was a very easy and interesting dish. I added a little olive oil as well and was generous with the dry mustard and honey. I also roasted the potatoes for close to an hour to make them very ...
4/28/2001,5,i made this as part of a thanksgiving dinner and they were ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!!!
4/19/2001,5,Very good.  So easy to do!  Next time I'd use a little more mustard but even still they were good!
12/26/2000,5,I was so pleased with this recipe. I fixed it for the first time this Christmas with company coming. Everyone raved.
12/26/2000,5,Absolutely delicious!
9/25/2000,5,Wonderful.  Slightly sweet full of flavor and so very easy to make.
4/9/2017,4,I tweaked the recipe slightly (to make more of a sauce) by doubling the honey and I added 2 tablespoon of apple juice 1 tablespoon of light brown sugar and minced garlic. Gotta have garlic on a...
1/1/2017,4,"Tasty!
Used 6-8 medium sized potatoes. Cut into bite sized pieces and boil in salty water for 5mins. Don't over boil. 
Double all ingredients other than potatoes.
Lay potatoes in a single layer ..."
11/15/2016,4,Will definitely make again!
11/14/2016,4,Tasted v yummy!
6/21/2016,4,A nice way to fix potatoes with a touch of sweetness.  Baked too!
4/2/2016,4,Very subtle sweetness. Mine were perfect at 30 minutes at 375. Mix butter honey and potatoes in a large bowl ensures even coating.
3/4/2016,4,Very tasty! I doubled up on the sauce and the onions and definitely do not regret it.
2/23/2016,4,Good flavour but the potatoes took far longer to cook than the recipe indicates. The onions were overcooked by the time that the potatoes were ready. I would suggest covering the pan with foil f...
2/23/2016,4,Next time I will cut the honey back a little. I finished them on the stove top to get them nice and brown.
2/9/2016,4,These were great.  Running short on time I cut the potatoes into pieces and microwaved them for 10 minutes then coated with melted butter mixture and baked.  They were done in 30 min.  Next tim...
1/25/2016,4,This was delicious.  For the two of us I halved the amount of potatoes but kept the rest of ingredients the same - though I upped the quantity of salt a bit.  I took the suggestions of other rev...
12/12/2015,4,These were so yummy!  However I found I needed to add a little bit more honey butter dry mustard salt and pepper after baking time since it seemed it evaporated.  I also baked them for over a...
10/24/2015,4,Very good! Only change I made was to add a little more honey.
10/2/2015,4,9/15 Jeff liked but prefers salts to sweet.  I really liked it. Not sure I'd double the sauce but it didn't seem like quite enough.
7/5/2015,4,Perfect side dish
3/29/2015,4,Yummy! I followed instructions except for two changes: 1) added 1 Tbsp stone ground mustard in addition to the dry mustard; 2) increased cook time to 45 minutes. I will definitely make again th...
3/3/2015,4,This was very sweet.  I think it would be good for yams!
1/27/2015,4,I made this recipe as is and it was freaking delicious. A tad bit on the greasy side so I might cut some of the butter next time but honestly these were awesome.
1/14/2015,4,Very good & easy to make!
10/25/2014,4,These were good and quick/easy to prepare. A nice sweeter version versus all the very savory roasted potato recipes out there.
9/30/2014,4,These were soooo good!  I doubled the sauce and subbed red pepper for the dry mustard.
9/5/2014,4,I really enjoyed this recipe but gave it 4 stars as I had to modify it slightly. I added an extra tablespoon of honey and used 1 tbs oil not butter. Also I cooked them for an hour. Turned out fa...
7/19/2014,4,Great side dish.
6/27/2014,4,I made sure to follow other people's advice and cut back on the amount of honey and mustard proportionally. Added 1/8th tsp of cayenne which added a bit more spice to contrast the sweetness of t...
6/26/2014,4,I couldn't taste the mustard so I would probably increase that next time. I used olive oil instead of butter and salted generously. Very good and I will make again!
5/27/2014,4,The potatoes taste good but I could not taste the flavor as much as I would have liked.  The next time I will make more of the sauce to pour on the potatoes before cooking.
5/7/2014,4,Loved these! Nice change.
4/25/2014,4,It wasnt bad. The flavors werent my style. Will not b making again
4/22/2014,4,Took the advice of others and added thyme oregano kosher salt rosemary and garlic powder...solid recipe...will probably try again with onions
3/27/2014,4,These were good.I wish they had more flavor to them or spicebut we will make these again.
1/20/2014,4,These were good potatoes and very easy to make.  If I were to make them again I would add more seasoning as I feel they lacked a little flavor and I would also allow for a much longer bake time...
1/2/2014,4,These were good. Pinch of salt though?? Come on! I used quite a bit of salt (1.5 tsp maybe) and added a bit more near the end of cooking. Roasted potatoes need salt. Other than that the family ...
11/10/2013,4,I've been making this recipe for a couple of years now as it became an instant hit with my family when I first tried it. It's also become my go-to side dish when I'm going to have company over b...
10/28/2013,4,These were really yummy :) I actually didn't have any red potatoes so I just used regular potatoes and it still turned out really good. Next time i would add a little more of the butter and hone...
6/3/2013,4,These were yummy! My only suggestion would be to reduce the butter as there was a bit too much of it for my liking. The honey gave them a nice flavouring without being to sweet. I will definite...
4/24/2013,4,"I think I was probably expecting a stronger honey flavor so they didn't turn out how I had expected but they were still yummy.

I added a bit more honey and wish I had put in a little less bu..."
4/19/2013,4,This is a great recipe.  I did not have dry mustard so I used some brown mustard.  I just squirted some on.  It was very good.
4/7/2013,4,I made this exactly as described because I didn't want the sweetness to be overpowering.  I melted the butter with the honey in a large bowl added the spices (and a bit of parsley for color) an...
3/10/2013,4,My family enjoyed these.  I think if I made them again I would double the sauce to drizzel on top.  Other than that I think I will make them again.
2/28/2013,4,I really liked this. I think next time I'm going to double the mustard and honey though. I didn't get as much of that flavor as I would have liked but enjoyed the potatoes anyway. Thanks for sh...
2/23/2013,4,This was a good dish. Did add extra honeysalt & pepper and upped some of the other ingredients. Loosely covered foil over potatoes and baked longer than 35 minutes. Very tasty !
2/1/2013,4,These were pretty good. I baked for an hour (covered with foil for 40 minutes and without foil for the last 20 minutes). I should have given them a quick broil at the end like the other reviews ...
11/25/2012,4,I thought these were great!  I used 3 Tbsp of honey and sprinkled the potatoes with parsley.  Used 5 medium/large red potatoes.
10/18/2012,4,It is a easy recipe. I doubled the recipe for my family. I made as written except I mixed everything together including the onion. Then poured over potatoes and mixed well. I did change the cook...
10/8/2012,4,It was delicious and very easy to make!
8/28/2012,4,Very good.  I par boiled the potatoes for about 5 minutes in the microwave then cut into small pieces.  I mixed the honey mustard topping  with the potatoes to coat everything.  No way this coo...
7/24/2012,4,Had too cook much longer even though I boiled them for 10-15 min first.
6/5/2012,4,Very good recipe. Only change I make is smaller potatoes.
5/12/2012,4,these were tasty. Will make again.
5/10/2012,4,These are yummy.  I preboiled them for about 5 minutes (based on another review.)  I put the potato slices in the honey/spice bowl to cover them well.
4/16/2012,4,Delicious. Used 3 Tbls. honey and 2 tsps. dry mustard. Saved time by boiling the potatoes for 8 mins. and then cut them into bite sized pieces. Baked for 30 mins. until tender. They would have n...
4/15/2012,4,Followed directions exactly and it was delicious!!
3/19/2012,4,Good stuff.  Wasn't sure about the honey at first but when all was said and done it was fabulous.  I did however have to bake mine for an extra 25 min it seems.
3/15/2012,4,These were so good!!! I omitted the onion because I don't like it but I followed the rest of the recipe exactly. I recommend cutting the potatoes into small chunks so they cook up more quickly;...
3/5/2012,4,This was really good. I doubled the sauce as suggested and I really liked the honey mustard flavor. I parboiled the potatoes to help them along and then broiled them the last few mins in the ove...
3/4/2012,4,Outstanding! My 4year old who eats like a bird ate all of them from her dinner plate. We love these. We've actually used them with 3 different kinds of potato. Enjoyed them every time. Great rec...
2/17/2012,4,Good but messy to make.
1/31/2012,4,good. added garlic because I do to everything and cooked longer. browning under the broiler is a must
12/21/2011,4,Nice with light-tasting meats/fishes.
11/25/2011,4,My family was put off by the strange sweet taste in the potatoes... we often have red potatoes that I've made for over 16 years using fresh garlic so I think it was just unexpected!
11/16/2011,4,These were pretty good not awesome but good for a different flavor. I would prefer more of a seasoned potato than a sweet flavor but not bad!
11/16/2011,4,"AWESOME!  I am not a potato person but these will now be made often.

Gave it 4 stars instead of 5 only because I felt it needed to be changed a bit for my taste.  

Did not add the onions becau..."
11/4/2011,4,
11/3/2011,4,I just made my first batch of these and they are very good! Next time I will probably use more honey... we don't keep onions on hand because my husband doesn't like their texture so I used onio...
11/1/2011,4,I liked this recipe a lot. I would make it again. The only reason I gave it 4/5 is that my husband and son didn't really go gaga over it so we had more than i wanted to eat alone left over :P
10/23/2011,4,Good but could use more honey.
10/13/2011,4,great recipe! I added some extra honey for a little sweeter taste.. will definetly make again.
10/3/2011,4,These potatoes were good.  However I would have liked a little more of the honey-butter taste to them.  I will add more of these ingredients next time.
9/27/2011,4,Good but not great.  Perhaps I just wasn't ready for the honey mustard taste.  I used honey dijon and added some parsley.  Also I broiled this dish at the end for 3-4 minutes to give it a good ...
9/26/2011,4,These little potatoes turned out wonderfully! I didn't have dry mustard and decided to use rosemary instead. So glad I did--it was delish!
8/11/2011,4,Pretty dang good. I would definitely double the sauce mixture next time. And make sure you mix it a few times during cooking. Also someone's suggestion of broiling them for a few minutes at the ...
8/6/2011,4,These turned out pretty good... I thought they seemed to lack flavor but I didn't really measure the amount of potatos I used.... so I could have been a little short on the sauce... also be sure...
7/14/2011,4,good. but i had to bake a lot longer and turn the heat up.
7/10/2011,4,yummy
7/5/2011,4,This was easy to make but the opinions on the results were mixed among my family. My daughter and I loved this recipe and we would have given it 5 stars except for the fact that my wife and ot...
7/3/2011,4,I added a bit more honey to the recipe but otherwise followed it completely.  These were awesome!
6/15/2011,4,These were delicious but the cooking time doesn't seem to be long enough for the size I cut the potatoes. This isn't the recipes fault these sorts of differences are bound to happen. I thought...
6/13/2011,4,Need to cook for at least 20 minutes longer.
6/9/2011,4,My 4 year old daughter was SO excited to try these! She thought they needed more honey but I thought they turned out great! I served these with a spicy chicken entree and they were a perfect co...
5/25/2011,4,Great recipe!!  I made a few changes. I used 3 tablespoons of honey 6 tablespoons of butter I used cayenne pepper instead of dry mustard.  I also used pik-mix instead of just chopped onion. It...
5/20/2011,4,Served with lightly fried pork chops and a side salad. Tasted great but I will double the sauce & onions next time.
5/6/2011,4,These were easy and good with a simple dinner they did lack the sweet honey pop my husband was hoping for though. I may do them again but tweak it to be a little more jazzy....
4/30/2011,4,I used triple the honey cranked the oven up to 400 and broiled them after they got soft.  Good but not making me crave them.
4/21/2011,4,These were okay I thought I'd try them instead of our usual garlic/butter/parsley red potatoes. But everyone in my family agreed they didn't really care too much for the sweet honey taste. I fo...
4/15/2011,4,These were good but I had trouble getting them tender.  They were still not finished after 45 min at 375 and then the sauce had started drying out.  I will make these again because my husband...
4/13/2011,4,Mild sweet flavour. Cut thick slices of onion rather than dicing it so it wouldn't burn. Cooked at 425ºF for 35 minutes.
4/12/2011,4,Very good.  I did need to put them under the broiler for a 5 minutes to brown them a little more.  But delicious my husband and 3 yr old son loved them.
4/12/2011,4,These were great!  But for my family it needed more flavor so we added more honey in the end and broiled the last 4 minutes.
4/11/2011,4,These turned out better than I expected. I used regular russet potatoes because it was what I had on hand and that worked fine. After reading several helpful suggestions I added cayenne but kept...
4/11/2011,4,These were good. I do agree with the other reviewers; the sauce should be doubled and maybe I didn't broil them long enough because they didn't get as crispy as I wanted but I will make them ...
4/11/2011,4,Very tasty! I added finely diced carrot to my potatoes. I also doubled the recipe which made a good bit. Will def make these on a regular basis.
3/29/2011,4,Won't give this five stars because I made too many changes but I'll give it four stars to keep the rating high so people try it. With these changes this recipe is easily in my top 10 greatest r...
2/28/2011,4,Good.
2/28/2011,4,These were decent but not the best I've ever had. Ever since I stumbled upon this recipe I've had a taste for it. Since I was serving a sweet-spicy main dish I felt these would complement it ...
2/11/2011,4,Very tasty but I found a little too much sauce.. Next time I will just toss them in a bowl.. They didn't seem to get that nice roasted taste.
1/25/2011,4,Excellent recipe but be sure to use minced onion (in the jar) NOT fresh onion...will definitely make it again.
1/17/2011,4,Awesome. I doubled the mustard & honey because I really wanted to slather the potatoes in it. Delicious! Definitely will make this again.
1/14/2011,4,A bit to sweet for me but my grandaughter loved them.
1/11/2011,4,I followed the recipe except I doubled the sauce.  It was delish!
1/1/2011,4,I thought these potatoes had a good flavor but not enough flavor. Cooking them on 375 for 35 minutes just wasn't enough time to really get the sauce to stick to the potatoes. We like our potato...
12/30/2010,4,Very easy great flavor!  Will make again!
12/19/2010,4,I doubled this recipe for my family of five. I used a jellyroll pan lined with aluminum foil and coated with cooking spray. Otherwise the honey makes the mixture sticky and clean-up time consum...
12/7/2010,4,These were good but for the cook time involved I don't know if I'd make them again.  They were super easy though and I love the combo of honey and mustard.  I used prepared mustard because my ...
12/5/2010,4,served this with roasted chicken and got rave reviews. I also doubled the butter and honey and substituted paprika for the mustard powder. i chopped up a couple of carrots too. I was a bit worr...
11/14/2010,4,Good recipe although I did add additional spices as other reviewers had suggested and tripled the honey.
11/11/2010,4,good but needs more sauce. Next time I will try and double sauce
11/9/2010,4,These were good but with some additions they were excellent. I had to bake a lot longer (maybe because I used Russet Potatoes..not sure) about 50 minutes. I tripled the sauce and added a bit mo...
11/4/2010,4,These werent bad but needed more flavor.
11/4/2010,4,These were okay- I didn't think that the flavor was that noticeable.
11/2/2010,4,Added 3T of honey as recommended!  So good!  Also lined the pan and very easy to clean up
10/26/2010,4,I doubled the sauce and used it on purple red and white potatoes cut into bite size pieces.  Very good!
10/12/2010,4,good side dish I will add a few more spices to it next time I make it
10/6/2010,4,I made these to have with our Sunday chicken.  They were wonderful.  I did not have any red potatoes used fingerling instead worked great.  I did double the honey mixure and lined the pan with...
10/5/2010,4,Very tasty! Made with just regular potatoes instead of red otherwise followed the recipe as written.  Great side dish and great crispy potatoes! Will make again :)
9/13/2010,4,This was good but missing something...  Not enough flavor.  I will try adding some red pepper next time...
9/11/2010,4,They were good but the flavor could have been a little stronger. Next time I'll add more of the spices.
9/1/2010,4,I doubled the sauce and used one and a half pounds of potatoes.  I think I would have liked it better if the potatoes had been more crispy.
8/20/2010,4,Doubled the sauce. The roasted onions really flavored the potatoes nicely. Maybe a little more salt next time. Yummy!
8/20/2010,4,Very good the kids ate their potatoes with out one complaint!
8/19/2010,4,I used 1-3/4 lb of baby reds so I used 3 T each of margarine and honey and 1-1/2 tsp of dry mustard. I  doubled (or even tripled the onion) because we like it. I also added about 1/4 tsp of cay...
8/16/2010,4,These were pretty good!  I had a few red potatoes that needed to be used up and found this recipe.  I didn't know how the honey would be in it but it was pretty good.  Not too over-powering.  Wi...
8/12/2010,4,made this a while back and I can still recall the taste of these roasted potatoes.. they had a tangy sweet taste that was quite interesting. the dry mustard and honey added a kick to the flavour...
8/10/2010,4,We thought these were good.  Will make again.
6/23/2010,4,Not rating it 5 stars only because this recipe could have doubled on the amount of sauce. I doubled the recipe but should have made more of the sauce so the potatoes would have had more flavor. ...
6/21/2010,4,Added some fresh rosemary and oh wow! these were fabulous. No leftovers!
6/16/2010,4,Yum we will be making these again!
6/15/2010,4,These potatoes are pretty good.  I have made a few times and found its best to double to butter/honey mixture and use a whole onion.  I really enjoy how caramelized the onions get.  Also I used...
6/11/2010,4,Excellent if you increase the 'sauce' by half. I didn't want to take the time to roast these so I cubed them up nice and small and boiled them for about 10 minutes then combined them in a nons...
5/18/2010,4,These were yummy! The whole family liked them I used onion flakes and some seasoned salt.
5/6/2010,4,Very good!  I love the sweet/salty combination.  I microwaved for a few minutes before baking so it wouldn't take as long.
4/30/2010,4,These were very good. I used dehydrated onion because I didn't feel like dicing an onion in order to secure 2 tablespoons worth. However the flavor was really nice so in the future I would dic...
4/25/2010,4,They were not bad but there wasn't much flavor.  Easy to prepare.
4/17/2010,4,Delicious. Like some other reviewers I needed to add extra mustard salt and pepper to suit my tastes. I used frozen diced onions and will use double next time -- they sort of melt away and rea...
3/18/2010,4,These were very good. I wasnt sure the honey would work but it did. Nice change for us. I only had white potatoes in the pantry so used those instead. Thanks!
3/17/2010,4,I made these tonight using mini red potatoes.  I did as other reviewers suggested and doubled the sauce and rebasted them half way through baking.  I found with the minis they baked a lot quicke...
3/10/2010,4,The only reason I gave it four stars because the flavor doesn't penetrate the potatoes enough. I recommend adding the sauce again right before serving.  Otherwise this is a definite keeper!
2/24/2010,4,Quantities were all wrong on this one but it was tasty.  I knew a pinch of salt for so many potatoes is not enough so I sprinkled salt and pepper on all potatoes for even covering.  It had no w...
2/15/2010,4,Very good!  I will definintely add more honey next time and less butter:)  Will make again soon!
2/12/2010,4,Really good although I thought they needed a lot more than a dash of salt.  Husband and I really liked them but the kids did not.
1/26/2010,4,These were good.  They're a bit sweet but good.  I cut them into quarters and boiled them until about half cooked.  Slapped 'em in a baking dish poured the sauce over them and voila.  We all ...
1/21/2010,4,The potatoes were very good but could have used a little more flavor. I will probably increase the mustard salt and pepper next time. I served with Balsamic Roasted Pork Loin and the flavors ...
1/19/2010,4,better with more honey and some herbs
1/7/2010,4,This was tasty but didn't wow me.  I left out onions as I do not like.  This was a spin on the typical baby reds and was enjoyed by my family.
1/3/2010,4,I liked these but they needed a little more flavour. I stirred them 3 times while cooking to make sure the honey mixture was well distributed. I also broiled them at the end for just a couple m...
1/1/2010,4,I made these with olive oil instead of butter and thought they were pretty good. i thought they couldve had more mustard-y flavor though so next time i may add more dry mustard. i also used a l...
12/31/2009,4,Pretty good.  Not my favorite way of making red potatoes but it was a nice side dish.  I like crispier roasted potatoes so I broiled for a couple of minutes at the end.  Thanks for the recipe.
12/31/2009,4,These did not roast evenly for me - next time I will stir them more than just once.  The ones that did roast properly were excellent.  Will definitely try again.
12/29/2009,4,this was a great recipe! simple and a really good side. I also added baby carrots to the mix a nice addition.
11/24/2009,4,This recipes was good! I added more onions and istead of chopping some of them I left some whole rings of onions for more flavor. :]
11/19/2009,4,Quick and easy to make.  Very tasty.
11/11/2009,4,These are good
11/2/2009,4,Super easy to do. Kids really liked this recipe so I give it 4 stars. It was just so-so for me.  I used roasted garlic olive oil instead of butter. I doubled the amount for the sauce.   Make su...
10/27/2009,4,These were very tasty! I loved the sweetness of them. I used New Potatoes instead of red. Yummy!
10/25/2009,4,Very good very easy.  I used half the butter cut the potatoes into bite sized pieces and salt and peppered to taste.  Cooked for about an hour stirring every 10-20 minutes.  A mellow sweet f...
10/7/2009,4,very very yummy... just had to add on a little cooking time.
10/5/2009,4,I used 3 tablespoons of honey and finished them off under the broiler to give them a crisp coating.  They were very good potatoes and I'll certainly make them again.
10/5/2009,4,They are pretty darned delicious - I recommend adding the broil step to ensure that you get crispier versus soggier! :)
10/1/2009,4,I like the idea of using honey but I think this needs a little more salt and pepper.  Also my cooking time was much longer.  After 35 minutes the potatoes were soft but definitely not roaste...
9/29/2009,4,These worked out great with fresh garden potatoes.
9/29/2009,4,A few alterations:  I doubled the butter honey mustard and S&P then due to being paranoid about not-fully-cooked potatoes I cooked 20 minutes at 375º and another 15 at 425º.  Excellent and ...
9/17/2009,4,A tide more taste would make this perfect.
8/27/2009,4,These were delicious. I followed some of the advice of the others and added more honey and substituted olive oil for the butter. I will definitely be making these often!
8/17/2009,4,Made this last night family enjoyed them. I think could've used more honey. Thank you for sharing this.
8/4/2009,4,These were very good but the sauce was too mild for my taste.  I did 'em again last night and doubled the honey and mustard and that was much better.  But I still think it's a bit too much work...
7/27/2009,4,Just 'okay' for my family. Kind-of pointless to cook this way when DH just adds ketchup. Not too much flavor of honey or mustard. Probably won't make again.
7/26/2009,4,I thought these were great but they have a mild flavor so if you are expecting an intense flavor you will be disappointed. My kids loved them I served them with Honey BBQ Meatloaf from the Tas...
7/21/2009,4,These were good -- followed the recipe exactly.  I will make these again.  Used some garlic too because I use it for everything :D Carmelized perfectly on the potatoes.
7/13/2009,4,I really enjoyed it hubby thought it was a little sweet but liked it well enough.
6/30/2009,4,I was impressed by these.  Changes I made:  - Substituted onions for 2 tsp onion powder which was put right into honey mixture - Cut potatoes into eighths instead of quarters (used medium to la...
6/29/2009,4,Very good.  There wasn't a strong flavor to them but we enjoyed them a great deal.  A nice sweet side for spicy chops.
6/25/2009,4,Really good - kind of different.  I will make it again.  I may try broiling the potatoes at end - mine were not crispy AT ALL which I expect of roasted potatoes.  Great week night or company's c...
6/12/2009,4,So I tried them today... they were just ok when they were hot. I went to the kitchen to find a snack later and omg these are awesome cold!! Now I know for next time let them cool then eat!! :-)
5/29/2009,4,I had to mix up this recipe a bit. I left out the dry mustard and used some cayenne pepper in its place. I also substituted chicken broth for the melted butter. I added a little bit extra honey....
5/8/2009,4,These potatoes were very good but not as wonderful as I thought they would be. To me they seemed a little greasy even after I reduced the amount of butter. Most of my family enjoyed them as w...
4/23/2009,4,Had these last night for dinner and they were fantastic!  I didn't have dry mustard so I added chili powder some cayenne and some thyme for extra herb flavor.  My only complaint is that they ...
4/22/2009,4,These were pretty darned good.  I like others wondered about the spices.  Very good though.  I doubled the ingredients also. I didn't have allspice so just added a tad bit more of the cloves nu...
4/21/2009,4,I followed others' advice and cooked them for longer and broiled them at the end.  I also used olive oil instead of melted butter and tossed the potatoes in it.  They came out great!!!  Didn't s...
4/20/2009,4,I liked this but the family wasn't so sure about the honey on the potatoes.
4/13/2009,4,These potatoes turned out very good however I should have taken the advice of others and doubled the honey mixture -- there just wasn't enough! I poured some last minute honey on top of the pot...
4/11/2009,4,Really easy and just enough flavor to take roasted potatoes up a notch.
4/8/2009,4,it was good but i think i used too much butter. next time i'll use less- it was my fault not the recipe's.
4/3/2009,4,Lovely recipe!  Made this for friends who just had a baby and my husband enjoyed them too.
4/3/2009,4,I made this the other night to go with steak.  I did increase the honey and dry mustard.  It had a good flavor although I may increase the honey even more next time.  I do think that I cooked it...
4/1/2009,4,Nice! I followed the recipe exactly except I flipped my potatoes after 35 minutes and cooked them an additional 15 minutes to get a caramel on them. Wonderful flavor thanks!
3/10/2009,4,Loved them!
3/8/2009,4,Really great just have to double the sauce! There wasn't enough sauce!! But def. a Keeper!!!
3/7/2009,4,This is a beautiful dish to serve! The flavor is nice the honey makes them special but my personal preference is to use more seasoning and a few more onions. I would suggest placing them under...
3/2/2009,4,This was good.  Thanks for sharing.
2/25/2009,4,Very good!  We felt this recipe was above average and it could accompany any meat dish.
2/19/2009,4,Very good. I scaled back the butter by half and doubled the honey and potatoes. Next time I will probably just omit the butter altogether as it really didn't seem to need it.
2/18/2009,4,we really enjoyed. I did triple the honey called for and used olive oil instead of the butter but the flavor was very good.
2/14/2009,4,Very tasty.  I enjoyed the addition of some cayenne pepper from another reviewer.  Also drizzled extra honey all over half-way through the cooking time.
2/6/2009,4,We really liked these potatoes.  Just a touch of sweetness from the honey but not overboard.  Yummy!
2/4/2009,4,Would have been plain as written. I tripled the onion doubled the honey left out the butter and doubled the salt & pepper. Baked for 15 minutes longer because I like them soft. Will add more ...
2/3/2009,4,These were different but in a good way!  I usually roast my potatoes in butter with garlic powder and black/red pepper so the sweet taste of these was a wonderful change.  Next time I make the...
1/28/2009,4,Next time I'll cut back on the butter. This is for my preference only. But over all a good side meal.
1/11/2009,4,"Very nice!  I love roasted veggies so it's always great to get a new recipe  I threw in some carrots since the honey glaze seemed to call out for them and they were fabulous.

Based on previou..."
12/31/2008,4,I absolutely LOVED these.  I like anything with honey in it though.  I doubled the sauce recipe and increased the honey amount to make it nice and sticky.  My husband didn't like them though. ...
12/31/2008,4,My husband loved this but i just thought it was o.k. it wasn't bad and wasn't good all at the same time. It was lacking a little flavor for me i was expecting something a little different jus...
12/29/2008,4,I followed some of the other suggestions and doubled up on the ingredients. Added a nice flavor to the potatoes. Very easy to do.
12/21/2008,4,I use any kind of potato with this recipe. Simple and good.
12/4/2008,4,These were great but I don't believe they would have been as good without changing in this way: half the butter 1/2 tsp. salt generous pepper 1 tsp. prepared mustard (in addition to the dry ...
11/30/2008,4,Very good - a nice change from the usual roasted potatoes.
11/21/2008,4,These are excellent! The only change I made was to add 3 tablespoons of honey instead of 1 because I really wanted the potatoes to taste a little sweeter. I also substituted the dry mustard for ...
10/21/2008,4,I took others' advice and used 2 Tbsp. honey mixed the ingredients beforehand and lined my dish with foil to avoid sticky clean up.  A big hit.  Next time I might try someone else's suggestion...
10/20/2008,4,These turned out good. Very sublte flavour.  Will make again but will add more heat maybe.  Thanks for sharing!!
10/16/2008,4,I liked these a lot.  I love potatoes and am always looking for variations.  The flavor is subtle but I enjoyed that it was not overpowering.  I made it a second time and added about 2 Tbs. of ...
10/5/2008,4,used half the butter which it was fine.  My husband thought that I made other potatoes that were better.  Toddler liked them and she doesn't really like potatoes.
10/1/2008,4,I prefer my potatoes mashed or fried so I had to turn to Mr. LTH for help rating these.  He said they're good and gave them a 4.  They were quick and easy to prepare yet mine did take long...
8/31/2008,4,This was a great recipe!  My only suggestion is to add a bit of season salt... otherwise it is a bit bland.
8/21/2008,4,Not bad!  My husband really loved these.  I will make again only with much more onion.  It definitely has a sweetness to it so it's more of an option of roasted potatoes along with a spicier o...
8/7/2008,4,Yummy! I was out of butter (who runs out of butter??)so I used a little regular olive oil and I only had regular mustard but I still tried the recipe out and these were great! Thanks!
8/6/2008,4,I liked these potatoes but will add a little more honey next time.  Didn't really have that sweet honey taste I was hoping for.
7/22/2008,4,Easy and good recipe!
7/11/2008,4,These were really yummy!  Not too sweet.  I did add more salt and broiled them for about 10 min after baking for 35.  (we like our potatoes crispy on the outside).  Definately stir them a coupl...
7/6/2008,4,Easy & something different than baked potato. I did take others suggestion & double the sauce & fry the onion. Will try using my roaster next time so it doesn't heat the kitchen during the summe...
7/5/2008,4,These were so good I made them with the sweet and sour meatloaf also on this site and it was a great compliment.  Next time I think I will add a little bit more honey.
7/3/2008,4,I have made these a couple of times now and they are one of the better roasted potato recipes I have found.  Definitely a keeper.
7/2/2008,4,I really liked these though many people who tried them were not really impressed.  I made double the amount of sauce and used the left over amount as a dip.  I think the honey taste is somethin...
6/28/2008,4,This recipe is definately a keeper.  My first try on them they came out a little dry.  I will try to modify the recipe next time I make them and I will definately be making them again.
6/27/2008,4,Easy enough for a beginner like me.  It tasted great but needed a lot more cook time.
6/16/2008,4,I was expecting the potatoes to come out crunchy and was disappointed by that until I tasted them. They were delicious and got rave reviews by everyone. I'll be adding this recipe to my box!
6/10/2008,4,My family really enjoyed these. I was worried about them being dry so after I cut them I put them in a storage bag with olive oil and shook them until they were covered. I then place them in a ...
6/8/2008,4,Good Recipe. used small yellow because I had no red. Also I didn't have dried mustard so I used regular dijon and they still tasted yummy. I eyeballed the honey amount- probably doubled. These w...
6/8/2008,4,Good!  Not amazing but very tasty.  I loved the onion in this dish.  The onion did brown quite a bit but they stuck to the potatoes and enhanced the flavour.  I did have to cook them for almost ...
5/23/2008,4,Very good. Nice flavor.
5/18/2008,4,Super tasty...but I read in other reviews that they could be a little dry and also took more time in the oven.  So...I cut the potatoes in smaller pieces and sauteed them with the onions in oliv...
5/12/2008,4,This was a good recipe.  I did add some Dijon mustard and some chopped Viadalia Onion.  Great flavor but it still came out a little dry for me but that can be fixed with a touch of olive oil. ...
4/22/2008,4,These were good I added more than a pinch of salt and pepper though. I had to cook mine a lot longer to get them nice and crisp.
4/22/2008,4,I added additional ingredients as suggested by others and still seemed to think these were lacking a bit in flavor.  I did cook them at 425 as suggested by others.  They were good just not grea...
4/6/2008,4,HELPFUL TIPS THAT WORK: I've made this exact recipe for several years now & have learned a few things.  They take me 40-60 min in the oven.  I just take a fork & occasionally poke it to see if ...
4/2/2008,4,Sweet and tasty!  I didn't measure anything when making these less the butter (new stick) - upped by 1/2 tbs.  Used a LOT more honey (I'd say between 1/3 and 1/4 cup).  Regular Mustard (no dry)...
3/28/2008,4,These aren't bad at all. I like the flavor - I used more than a pound of potatoes so I made more sauce and I cut them in smaller chunks. I also used white potatoes (all I had). Next time I will ...
3/20/2008,4,I used plain French's mustard from the fridge and added quite a bit of black pepper.  They turned out very tender and spicy with just a touch of sweetness.  I think next time I'll a bit more hon...
3/19/2008,4,These were good but not as flavorful as I'd hoped...I'll stick to rosemary garlic for now.
3/18/2008,4,Very very good! These took longer than the time suggested. I used onion and garlic powder 4tbs margarine was out of honey so I used corn syrup and added salt to taste. They got nice and cris...
3/11/2008,4,Nice flavor on this dish but I did double the sauce and onion. I cooked these at 400 since I was baking poultry too and it still took the 35 min to cook. I stirred these halfway through. They w...
3/11/2008,4,The first time I made this I followed the directions exactly but as many others have stated they were a little dry and bland.  The second time I made them I cooked them longer as others suggest...
3/6/2008,4,These were good but I feel like they needed a little more salt and I really didn't taste the sweet from the honey.  I will try again and add just a bit more.
2/29/2008,4,Very unique flavor.  I wasn't sure how sweet would go with potatoes but it was very good.  4 1/2 stars from my husband!
2/19/2008,4,These potatoes were super simple to make!  They had just the right amount of sweetness.  My husband and I both thought that sweetness aside they were a little bit tasteless.  Maybe more honey/...
2/17/2008,4,The sauce on these was phenomenal. I would suggest doubling even tripling it however. I doubled it and I still thought it wasn't quite enough. Also depending on the size of your potatoes you may...
1/28/2008,4,These were very good made as is.  Very simple and delightful!  Thanks!
1/24/2008,4,Great recipe. Next time I will double the sauce. Also used half sweet potatoes and half red potatoes and I loved the two types of potatoes. My husband loved it and we will make it again.
1/22/2008,4,I did not have the complaint about being bland as other reviews have.  Actually my husband thought they were a little too sweet but the kids sure ate them up.  Next time I will leave the honey ...
1/17/2008,4,This was a good recipe - I tried to halve it and it really didn't have much of a flavor.  My husband liked it though - I will try again.
1/15/2008,4,Made these last night with potato parsnip and carrot - the parsnips were the best I've ever had but the potatoes and carrots while good weren't as different as I'd hoped. Ended up doing them...
1/13/2008,4,These were great!  My whole family really liked them.  I'm giving it a 4 only because they aren't real diet friendly but otherwise they'd be a 10.  Try em you'll like em.  :)
12/19/2007,4,These had a nice uniquely sweet flavor that I really enjoyed.  They aren't my favorite way to make potatoes and my husband wasn't a big fan but I think I would make them again since they were...
12/16/2007,4,I thought they were very tasty.  The sweetness was a nice touch.  The pan was a messy clean-up - tin foil may be good here.  I would not change a thing.
12/3/2007,4,Half the family really liked it and the other half thought it was okay. I was one of the people who liked it and I would make it again.
11/23/2007,4,I've tried this as originally posted.  That gets 4 stars because the potatoes never got as browned up as I like.  Used the suggestion of other reviewers and used olive oil instead of the butter....
11/19/2007,4,This recipe was delicious.  Since I love sauces and seasonings I doubled the butter mixture.  I also added baby carrots and I chopped more than 2TBSP worth of onions.  My husband love it.
11/14/2007,4,This was OK.  My guys liked it but I thought it was a little bland.
10/30/2007,4,Followed recipe exactly except for adding double the amount of diced onion. Could have been a tiny bit sweeter (dab more honey). Loved it.
10/28/2007,4,These were good but could use a little more seasoning. Mine took longer to bake probably closer to 45 minutes. Next time I will add more mustard and maybe some crushed rosemary.
10/26/2007,4,I was looking for a different way to roast some baby reds and I came across this.  When I saw my good friend Nandabear liked them I know I had to give them a try....I followed the recipe and lov...
9/30/2007,4,We really liked these potatoes.  I doubled the recipe and used extra salt and pepper.    It does need to cook longer than 35 minutes.  I even put it under the broiler because we were waiting on ...
9/27/2007,4,Simple and delicious.  Next time I will double the sauce and maybe adjust the honey depending on what I serve it with.
9/17/2007,4,I used scallions instead of onions and it was very good. Nice and simple and everyone liked it.
9/14/2007,4,This was a quick and easy way to cook potatoes!
8/25/2007,4,I really liked this recipe. Like others I felt the sauce needed to be doubled although the sauce in itself is very delicious. I also added a teaspoon Worchestire sauce which I think tasted rea...
8/24/2007,4,I added lime juice to the sauce to fit my meal.  Turned out well.
8/13/2007,4,Very good! My husband is a die hard potatoes guy and he loved it. I followed the recipe exactly as written and it turned out great.
7/23/2007,4,The mixture of the onions and the honey made for a very tasty dish.  I did not taste the mustard at all.  This was a good side dish and an excellent compliment to a meal.
6/6/2007,4,Good potatoes not the best but still very good. I cooked them at 400 degrees as suggested by other reviews. Will definitely make them again. Nice switch from mashed potatoes.
4/18/2007,4,I really liked this recipe. The sweetness to the potatoes was really good. I would have to increase the cooking time next time because some potatoes were still a little too firm for my taste.
2/18/2007,4,Delicious!  I cranked up the oven to 400 and baked until golden.
12/2/2006,5,Awesome!

3/14/2006,5,The absolute best!
3/14/2006,5,My family loves these! Make twice as much topping split in two and add it to the batter before pouring it into the cups. Gives the bottom a little more snaz.

3/5/2006,5,Great texture - moist and hold together well.  Great taste too. Too much leftover crumb topping mix though.  Next time I will try a different crumb topping - maybe with margarine and brown sug...

2/26/2006,5,I used whole wheat flour and they came out great.  I would recommend using non-stick spray instead of paper cups.  And don't fill them TOO full or else they will bleed together.  Next time I wil...

1/26/2006,5,I used frozen cut up strawberries instead...I used a cup but will put a cup and a half next time (or add some bannanas). I felt like the muffin part needed something adding almond or vanilla ex...

8/18/2005,5,I used fresh Michigan blueberries and this is the best recipe I have ever tasted.  I have also tried replacing the blueberries with peaches and it was also very good.  I followed the recipe to a...

8/16/2005,5,Incredible! And so easy! I think I need to stir my even less next time so that they are even more fluffy. My recipe only made 6 muffins though instead of 8 when I filled the cups full. I didn't ...
8/16/2005,5,These were great as muffin tops! Instead of pouring them into muffin pans put them on a cookie sheet like a cookie. I used my stones and made 12 of them. They were superb! Don't forget the crum...

8/10/2005,5,Wonderful recipe!  I made a few changes; I added 2 mashed very ripe bananas and I didn't have any butter so I skipped the crumb topping and just sprinkled a little white sugar on top.  They w...
8/9/2005,5,I have made these muffins six times since finding the recipe two weeks ago.  I have kept the recipe exactly the same for the batter but since the topping ingredients make so much there is always...

7/31/2005,5,These are delicious muffins! I made them filled right up to the top of the tins. Yum!!
7/30/2005,5,This recipe was FANTASTIC.  The grain was even and it was very moist.  I followed the idea of another and left the muffins in the pan until cool to prevent breakage.  For a fancy presentation I...

7/24/2005,5,Great except . . . the topping recipe makes too much topping. . . I think reducing the oven to 350 would work better & and filling the cups to the top is overkill and messy.  Next time I will ha...
7/24/2005,5,Very good blueberry muffins.  I've shared with two of my neighbors and they both asked for the recipe.  A new family favorite.

7/20/2005,5,Awesome! This recipe calls for WAY too much topping though. 1/3 of the topping is sufficient. Also the more blueberries the better.
7/20/2005,5,Marvelous! Instead of monster muffins I made average cupcake size. I used a large #20 cookie scoop to fill each cup uniformly and topped each with a tablespoon of crumb topping. They looked wond...

7/17/2005,5,Delicious and easy. I added more fresh blueberries and had a taste of blueberry in every bite. I am going to try to freeze a couple to see how they keep.

7/4/2005,5,These always turn out so well. I make 16 regular size muffins. They almost have a sour cream muffin-like heaviness.

6/29/2005,5,This is an awesome recipe and so easy to double.  A new favorite in our family.  Thanks for sharing!
6/28/2005,5,Delicious and easy. Good with some lemon juice and rind. Cut the sugar back to 1/4c and they are still plenty sweet for me.
6/28/2005,5,Tasted great! Crunch top adds a great new twist to an old favorite.  Used a mini muffin pan instead and made several dozen muffins.  Reduce baking time to 12 - 15 minutes with mini muffin pan.
6/27/2005,5,These muffins were great.  I did as some other reviewers suggested and added 2 teaspoons of vanilla.  I also doubled the blueberries and coated them in flour before folding into the batter.  I d...

6/26/2005,5,Wonderful and easy everyone loved the muffins.
6/24/2005,5,For best results use Vitamin D (Whole) Milk. For a lower fat version other grades of milk may be substituted but you will definitely taste the difference.

6/1/2005,5,These are fantastic muffins.  I used Splenda for half of the sugar and also made 12 regular size muffins.  Cooking time was about 18 minutes for 12.
5/26/2005,5,These taste just like the ones you get at the muffin bakery near us. They are fantasic right out of the oven! They should have 6 stars instead of 5 rating.

12/5/2004,5,I made these yesterday and they are great!  The only little problem I had was that I doubled the recipe because we like blueberry muffins so much and there was way too much crumb topping when ...
11/30/2004,5,Made these for a work function everyone raved about them delicious.
11/25/2004,5,I too liked this recipe very much and agree with a few of the comments so far: don't fill the cups quite so full and add some vanilla. Nothing like from-scratch blueberry muffins in the morning...
11/23/2004,5,I've been making these muffins for years in HUGE batches for my entire extended family every time I go blueberry picking.  They are so moist and SOOOOO GOOD!  Don't forget to shake the blueberri...

10/15/2004,5,i have heard that if you leave the blueberries frozen they won't sink to the bottom.
10/12/2004,5,This recipe is amazing.  I've made them two different ways...regular size and mini muffins.  The mini size are perfect for a brunch or shower.  I checked them after 15 minutes to see if they wer...

10/9/2004,5,Excellent! My roommate LOVED them! I wish I had put in more blueberries... very good though!
10/4/2004,5,Absolutely the best.
9/26/2004,5,This was actually a great recipe.   But it was a bit salty.  Will decrease the salt to 1/4 teaspoon next time...I did add about a 1/4 cup wheat flour and a little more milk.
9/25/2004,5,Yes indeedy!!! I made 12 out of this recipe & baked for 25 minutes. Bakery quality or better!!! Thanks!

9/22/2004,5,My family are super-picky when it comes to muffins and these were a HUGE hit.
9/20/2004,5,I really think that the crumb topping is what makes this muffin awesome.  I greased the cups before filling them but I did have some trouble getting the muffins out.  After breaking some becaus...

8/30/2004,5,Excellent recipe! Followed recipe it came out perfect. Great flavors.
8/29/2004,5,This recipe is truly bakery quality; if not better!  Using canola oil keeps the muffins heart healthy.  Instead of the crumb topping I use cinammon sugar and still get raves.
8/28/2004,5,I substituted a cup of raspberries instead and ran out of regular flour so I used cake flour.  Made it very delicate though.  Excellent.  Next time I'll use more than a cup of berries and make l...

8/12/2004,5,Easily 5 stars! I didn't read the reviews first so I freaked a little when the batter was like a cookie dough. I added more milk till it looked similar to other muffin batter. They turned out a...
8/12/2004,5,I have always liked blueberry muffins but these I LOVE!!! I might actually choose one of these over a chocolate chip cookie (which says a lot for me!).
8/11/2004,5,I was a little worried when I saw the batter - it had the consistency of cookie dough but the result was awesome. A delicious muffin.

7/23/2004,5,Best blueberry muffins I have ever had. The only thing I would do differently is use a little less blueberries than the recipe calls for. I will definitely make these again!
7/23/2004,5,I THOUGHT THESE MUFFINS TURNED OUT GREAT!! VERY MOIST HUGE AND THE CRUMB TOPPING WAS YUMMY.  I DOUBLED THE RECIPE AND GOT 14 AVERAGE SIZE MUFFINS.  LET COOL COMPLETELY BEFORE REMOVING.

But good stuff."

1/13/2004,5,This recipe is unbelievably great! My finance and my neighbor was so impressed! I did reduce the surger to 1/2 cup. Thank you so much! My fiance said this is the best breakfast I ever made!!
1/12/2004,5,Excellent! This recipe is great! The only change I made was to add 1 tsp vanilla to batter and I baked in a 8 X 8 pan instead to cut squares for smaller portion sizes. My honey loved it. I will ...
1/11/2004,5,Great recipe.  I did add 2 tsp. vanilla extract to make it even yummier!
1/9/2004,5,Delicious!  I added 2 TBS milled flax seed to this recipe.  Also I used 50/50 whole wheat flour/all purpose flour.  When I was measuring the all purpose flour I added 1 tsp powdered milk 1 TBS...
1/7/2004,5,These are great!  My whole family likes these and my husband is not even a big blueberry fan.  Even the kids eat them.  It is also a very easy recipe. Thanks for the recipe Colleen!
1/2/2004,5,The cinnamon topping was great the muffins were great...I don't need another recipe!

12/30/2003,5,I think these muffins were quite good.  I substituted the all purpose flour in the muffins for 1/2 oatmeal & 1/2 whole wheat flour and substituted unsweetened applesauce for the vegetable oil b...
12/26/2003,5,WOW. Now this is a GOOD recipe. I added more blueberries in mine. and I didn't follow the directions about putting the egg milk etc in a 1 cup container. I just added the amount of milk it cal...

11/30/2003,5,After reading a number of the reviews I made these muffins following the recipe exactly except for two things; the topping and the amount of batter placed in each muffin tin.  I was a little co...

11/22/2003,5,"These were without a doubt the best muffins I have ever made!

I made these again last night instead of cubing butter I just cut it with a pastry knife much easier."
11/13/2003,5,Loved by one and all!  I substituted frozen berries for fresh just thawed them on paper towels prior to adding.  They make excellent mini muffins and freeze well.
11/9/2003,5,this were so good.  I doubled the recipe.  My sister in law is always asking when I will be making them again.  I'm going to try them today with frozen blueberries.  Hope I get the same results.
11/7/2003,5,This is my only recipe for muffins.  The muffin itself is a little dry (probably an error on my part) but the topping makes them absolutely wonderful.  This is what I make when asked to bring s...
10/19/2003,5,These muffins were delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfectly.  I would half streusel topping the next time I make them.
10/18/2003,5,This recipe makes perfect blueberry muffins--they rise beautifully yet they are still very moist. I used 1/6 c. oil and 1/6 c. applesauce to cut down on fat a bit and they still turned out per...

9/12/2003,5,These muffins were delish!!!  I made 12 regular sized muffins but I liked the option of making large deli style muffins.  Just don't fill the muffin cups to the top with batter (they spread!!) ...
9/10/2003,5,These were something else!  I didn't use near as much topping based on the reviews I read that way it wouldn't fall apart.  They taste like something at a bakery..definitely not something in a b...

9/1/2003,5,A wonderful recipe -- a treat to eat and a treat to make!  These are indeed big muffins but if you use an oversized muffin tin (jumbo deli size) it really only makes about four muffins.  They're...
8/31/2003,5,These were delicious.  A word of avice for those of you using larger muffin tins; do not fill them all the way.  Fill them 3/4 of the way or else they'll explode all over the oven. (I found this...

8/6/2003,5,These are my very favorite muffins I've made them 6 times so far and they've been perfect each time. If you're used to (and like) box muffins these might take some getting used to. These are n...

8/3/2003,5,Amazing taste!  Instead of 1/3 cup oil I split that to 1/4 cup applesauce and used oil to bring it to 1/3 cup - a very nice compromise.  I can't stress enough that you must oil the muffin tins ...

5/10/2008,5,Everyone always enjoys these eggs when I bring them!  Be warned they are very strong smelling with the combo of the eggs and onions but DELICIOUS!
4/23/2008,5,Oh these were GREAT!! I loved them and will be making again and again
4/23/2008,5,it's one of the best recipes i have come across and it's very simple too.
4/20/2008,5,These were great and very easy!  I made them for Easter and they disappeared quickly after placing them up for grabs.  I will definitely use this recipe again.
4/13/2008,5,"Great eggs... very easy this is third time
celery salt works if you don't have celery. Also great with or without onions. 
Thank you Hipp."
4/11/2008,5,These received a lot of compliments at Easter dinner! I added a little bit of mustard powder to mine.
4/8/2008,5,This is the same recipe that my Nan made every holiday when I was growing up. I have tried many others but I always come back to this one and it's the only one that my kids will eat. I always ma...
3/27/2008,5,I made these at a cookout and they were gone in seconds!  They were great!  Next time I will definately add mustard and more hot sauce and maybe a little cayenne.  It was a little bland for my t...
3/26/2008,5,Really good. Easy and it was gone in seconds.
3/25/2008,5,I don't eat eggs at all but going by my family's rave reviews I would say that this recipe is the best! I served these eggs at a family gathering and they were gone in 10 seconds flat! The onl...
3/25/2008,5,These were one of the best deviled eggs I've made. Big hit for easter!  I added about a tablespoon each of shallot and green onion instead of the onion called for.  Used maille dijon - about 2 h...
3/24/2008,5,These were devoured pretty quickly by guests I guess that means they're good!  I like them also. I added onion omitted celery used a couple dashes of hot sauce for 20 eggs. I used prepared m...
3/24/2008,5,My daughter can't eat mustard so I was happy when I found this recipe.  And everyone at our Easter dinner thought they were great!
3/23/2008,5,Extremely good.  I loved the texture from the onions and celery.  There has been mentioned that the onions and celery do not give it much taste.  I recommend using finely chopped white onions.  ...
3/23/2008,5,Delicious!!  I used green onions and instead of all mayo did half mustard. I also put about 3 dashes of hot sauce. Loved the crunch of the celery/onion!  The bits of green mixed in gave a pret...
3/23/2008,5,And I certainly did add more hot sauce because why the heck not? I love deviled eggs and these were fantastic and I too added a little dijon mustard and a few seasonings. Thanks so much!!
3/23/2008,5,This was a great recipe. I ended up adding some celery seed a bit more hot sauce and some chives. It was really tasty. Classic but jazzed up.
3/21/2008,5,YUM!  These got raves when I made them.  I felt they could use a bit more hot sauce to taste.  Note:  If you're not a celery fan than find another recipe.  I thought the celery was a nice textu...
3/20/2008,5,Excellent recipe! :D Tip: Press the yolks through a sieve - makes it creamy and lump-free!
2/20/2008,5,Easy to work with and tastes great. I added some dijon mustard as others had suggested and sprinkled with paprika.
2/7/2008,5,"Delicious! Nice and creamy with a great texture! The thing I like the most about these deviled eggs is the hint of hot sauce. It gives the eggs a nice spicy taste!


I will definitely make these..."
2/4/2008,5,I took this and make Egg Salad out of it. Worked great! Loved it.
2/3/2008,5,This is how my Mom has been making deviled eggs since I can remember. The celery and onions need to be chopped very fine. For a great presentation place mixture into a plastic bag and cut off th...
1/29/2008,5,amazing. creamy and delicious. celery makes for nice texture. so good my dog passed up the turkey on the counter to steal the eggs! (bad dog...)

12/15/2007,5,Deelicious!!
12/6/2007,5,These were so yummy they were gobbled up instantly at the appetizer table. Will make again!
11/29/2007,5,My Family made these at Thanksgiving and they were really good. We wanted something that was a little different from what my mom used to make and we are definitely   making these again.  Next ti...
11/23/2007,5,Flew off the plate! This recipe was great I would have never though to add hot sauce.  I did add way more than recipe called for for a more spicy kick.  I also added a little bit of regular ye...
11/18/2007,5,We really liked these deviled eggs. Instead of celery and salt I used celery salt. I loved it. That is what I put in my tuna fish also. This is a very simple recipe where the results are great.
10/10/2007,5,Mmmm very tasty.
10/7/2007,5,I just made this last night for a church potluck - they were gone in seconds - enjoy!
8/5/2007,5,This was incredible! My family and I really loved this recipe! I would add a tad more Tabasco sauce but otherwise it was perfect! I will definately make it again!
8/3/2007,5,Loved them! Will make again!
7/9/2007,5,VERY quick and easy. it was my first time to make em and all my friends were impressed. I did add a little dijon mustard to give it a smoother texture. VERY DELICIOUS!
7/4/2007,5,this recipe was great.  I made it for a bbq and I got plenty of compliments.  I used less onions than the recipe called for
6/27/2007,5,These were really really good so good in fact that I ate 4 before dinner I have to admit I did not add the hot sauce it did not seem right but after reading the reviews I will the next time ...
6/14/2007,5,These were fantastic deviled eggs.  I followed the recipe but I used cayenne pepper instead of chili or hot sauce.  I kept adding a little at a time into the mix until they had enough heat.  I w...
6/5/2007,5,I didn't use the celery or onion and added a squirt of yellow mustard and some relish.  The hot sauce really makes these eggs the best.  For half a dozen eggs I used about 7-8 drops of Louisiana...
5/12/2007,5,Super Yummy and my new go-to deviled egg recipe!  Thank you! I loved the addition of the hot sauce.  The only thing I did differently was to add a tsp of dijon mustard and I used celery seed in...
5/7/2007,5,Seriously awesome recipe. By far the best deviled eggs I've tasted.
4/23/2007,5,those were great! I made 8 eggs and we just had those for dinner lol. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this recipe. I sort of eye-balled all of the ingrediants and made it to my taste.  I added...
4/14/2007,5,Yum I just tried this recipe.  I'll bring these deviled eggs to my next family get together.
4/7/2007,5,Really really good I added a good shot of dijon mustard. And used red onion as my onions of choice and it was a hit! Have to guard the fridge so they can make it Easter dinner!
3/24/2007,5,This was amazing!! I kept adding the chopped celery and onion in small amounts and tasting it along the way and ultimately ended up needing less than posted in this recipe. Great recipe - will ...
3/21/2007,5,These were amazing!  I added some mustard powder instead of the chili sauce but they still turned out great!
2/8/2007,5,I was out of relish to make my regular deviled eggs so I thought I would try this and we really enjoyed this for a change.  Hot sauce is a nice addition!
1/9/2007,5,These are YUMMY!!!  I have never had a deviled egg in my life so I have nothing to compare them to but I have definitely become a fan.  I didn't have any celery on hand so I used sweet relish ...
11/23/2006,5,I was careful with the mayo and instead of hot pepper sauce used cayenne and white pepper to spice up the base mixture which worked amazingly well. Even the white pepper alone was powerful and ...
11/21/2006,5,I like this recipe for a change.  I use Frank's Red Hot Buffalo wings sauce for the hot sauce. (it is not as hot as it sounds) I also like to add some jalapeno mustard. I have also used tobasco ...
11/20/2006,5,I used wasabi mayo and substituted red onion for white.  It was just the right amount of kick.  I love the teture the onion and celery gave to the eggs.
7/5/2006,5,I absolutely love this recipe! I've made these a few times now and there are never any left. In fact I made them for 4th of July and they barely made it from the kitchen to the food table...  I...
4/26/2006,5,THE ONLY DEVILED EGGS I EAT!!!!!
12/19/2005,5,I added quite a bit more hot sauce (although it still didn't seem very spicy...maybe I overloaded my taste buds w/ sweet & spicy pickles) & I loved them!  did sprinkle some w/ paprika & some wit...
11/22/2005,5,I've never used hot sauce but the rest is how I am used to preparing deviled eggs.  I'm trying this new recipe out on Thanksgiving.  Thanks for the idea!

7/5/2005,5,Yummy!  I loved the extra kick with the hot sauce!
4/9/2005,5,I made this just this morning and I thought they were fantastic.  I've never made deviled eggs before so I have nothing to compare them to but they were very good.  A big hit with the family.
7/3/2003,5,These eggs were a hit at the cabin.  They didn't last until dinner.  I added a good squirt of yellow mustard and some pepper to the recipe.  I made sure to mince the onion and celery very fine ...

5/10/2003,5,Itook these to my inlaws for Easter and everybody loved them. they liked them better than your basic deviled eggs. I think next time i will add a few more dashes of hot sauce
4/17/2003,5,Oh my! Absolutely the best ever!  The onions and celery give it crunch and the hot sauce yummmy!!!  This is a keeper!
4/17/2003,5,Yum! The only change I made was to add some fresh ground pepper. The hot pepper sauce was a great idea to give it some kick-add to individual preference.
3/14/2003,5,I am well known for my deviled eggs or I should say my old deviled eggs. I made this recipe for a party and I have to admit it was better than my old recipe. The onions and celery add just the ...

2/5/2003,5,This is exactly the way I make deviled eggs.  The recipe is also exactly how my mother makes her eggs as well.  I never had a deviled egg that would make me want to deviate from this recipe.  I ...
7/6/2002,5,Excellent!  They were a big hit.  Gone in minutes.
11/24/2001,5,The deviled eggs were greatthey made to die for appetizers.This is a recipe I will use again and again.
11/22/2001,5,This recipe was quick and easy! I made it for a Thanksgiving appetizer and everyone LOVED them!
12/31/2016,4,These were pretty good and everyone enjoyed them.  To be fair I would rate these a 4.5 without any changes.  I think they definitely need a teaspoon of Dijon Mustard & a 1/2 tsp salt added to t...
12/27/2016,4,Made according to recipe and will make it again.
11/20/2016,4,It was really good! I added Dijon mustard and personally liked extra spice but still very good!
7/5/2016,4,This is a great starting point for a deviled eggs recipe! I like a tangier filling so I added dijon mustard white vinegar and extra hot sauce (Louisiana Hot Sauce). They weren't spicy at all b...
12/31/2015,4,This was a very good recipe..  A little too much onion for me.  I will make again and use a little less.  All in all this was a great recipe and very easy to make.
3/24/2015,4,A great basic recipe.  Simple and delicious!  I like to add a little sweet relish and some minced fresh jalapeno or habanero peppers (no seeds).
12/28/2014,4,I changed it a bit. I use dill relish onion powder garlic powder smoked paprika onion soup mix (I just use a little of the mix not the onions)dukes mayo mustard and a little mustard powder...

12/12/2014,4,i love it
4/22/2014,4,First time ever making deviled eggs crazy I know.  But this recipe was a good guideline for me.  I did leave out the celery and onion as we are not fans of crunchy bits in the mixture.  I add...
11/24/2013,4,Mine didn't have enough of a kick and I missed the dijon mustard.
5/5/2013,4,I enjoyed these but I after making the mixture something told me to add dijon mustary about 1/2 teaspoon and then it went to 5 star recipe.  I like the celery crunch in it.
3/31/2013,4,Turned out great! I used some or the rooster-sauce for the hot sauce.
3/30/2013,4,We didn't have any celery but aren't big fans of it anyway so we left that out.  That may be why these tasted just a little heavy on the mayo at first.  We added a few more drops of hot sauce ...

2/4/2013,4,I just made these eggs.. I pretty much followed the recipe.. I added a little dijon mustard.. a bit of sweet relish and smoked paprika..in and on top. Dash of salt and pepper.. yum. I like the c...
1/3/2013,4,This is good but a little bland. I usually add a small amount of spicy mustard and sometimes some relish. It really helps the mixture come to life.
1/2/2013,4,I made a double batch of these for our Christmas snack table. What a hit! They were gone in minutes.
5/9/2012,4,I added sweet relish instead of celery very tasty
4/27/2012,4,Oh man with onions minced into the egg I had an onion hangover for the entire day.  I might add a lot less next time.
4/9/2012,4,Very delicious but I made the following adjustments: used red onion added a splash of white wine vinegar and a dollop of Dijon mustard. My other suggestion would be to do a full dozen eggs beca...

1/1/2012,4,Delish they were a huge hit on New Yrs eve.
11/30/2011,4,good standard recipe. missed a little tang....

8/28/2011,4,excellent! use in egg salad sandwhiches!

5/2/2011,4,Really really good. I used red onion.
5/1/2011,4,pretty good!
4/25/2011,4,Loved the addition of finely diced celery & onion (though not as much as the recipe calls for) but we needed to add some dijon & relish to give this enough flavor. Topped with paprika black pe...
4/24/2011,4,These were quite good.  I followed the recipe and finished with smoked Spanish paprika.  My kids and hubby liked them as well.
4/6/2011,4,A great recipe.  Everyone always loves them.
2/9/2011,4,Made as is. :) Was great.
1/18/2011,4,Delicious.
12/28/2010,4,Very Yummy :)
12/1/2010,4,I'm not exactly sure how to rate this since I do not like hard boiled eggs.   I did try one and these aren't dry flat and tasteless like other deviled eggs I've had.  I could actually eat these...
11/27/2010,4,Really good..
11/25/2010,4,Very simple good recipe. My family enjoyed it very much. Especially love the splash of hot sauce!!
11/13/2010,4,perfect blend of ingredients! (i added some dijon mustard & used a lite mayo) but it got good reviews from our dinner guests; recipe is a definite keeper. =)
8/2/2010,4,I haven't found a deviled egg recipe that I absolutely love yet but this one will work until then or with a few adjustments.  The onion and celery add a very nice egg-salad-like quality to thes...
7/12/2010,4,These were a little too onion-y for my taste but still good.
5/16/2010,4,I made these for a Baby Shower. Wow!!! They came out good. I also added some cream cheese. Everyone loved them.
4/10/2010,4,great!
4/4/2010,4,The celery and onion made a great twist! While these aren't like traditional deviled eggs they were...EGGcelent! The filling was just a bit runnier than what I usually like :o)
1/9/2010,4,Was Good. Just needed a lot more hot sauce than called for and ground mustard. Also try to put the celery and onion in the food processor so it's not chunky.
1/7/2010,4,This is a great recipe. My family is not a fan of celery so we left that out. I used about a tablespoon more mayo than called for added 1.5 teaspoons of mustard and added salt and pepper to ta...
1/5/2010,4,This recipe was so good!  I did listen to other reviewers and added in some dijon mustard.  If you don't have a chopper it can take forever to get the celery and onion small enough.

5/27/2009,4,good I needed more than a dash of hot pepper sauce.
5/19/2009,4,I made this for a party I went to this weekend and they were a hit.  I did add some things to it for my personal preference - 1/2 Tablespoon sweet pickle relish a teaspoon of prepared mustard a...
4/14/2009,4,I made these for Easter.  Very creamy and crunchy at the same time.  A bit runny though. Everyone liked them.
4/12/2009,4,This is a great basic deviled egg recipe that is easy to make variations with but always works. I have swapped red onions for the white miracle whip instead of mayo and other small variations ...
11/27/2008,4,These are the first deviled eggs that I've made myself and this recipe is quite good.
9/24/2008,4,These were good. I don't know how you can mess up deviled eggs. And I don't know what constitutes outstanding deviled eggs - I've never had any. They are all just pretty good. So were these.
9/22/2008,4,very good
5/12/2008,4,Looking for a twist on traditional deviled eggs I tried these. I followed the recipe exactly and felt it needed some additional kick which is the reason for the 4 star review. As far as my add...
5/5/2008,4,Made this for an Easter luncheon. It was well received. I would add a little more hot sauce for more taste.
3/26/2008,4,These were really good devilled eggs...except I found the amount of mayo to be a bit much.  Next time I would reduce by 1 Tbsp and go from there...I found the mixture to be a bit to runny.  The ...
3/22/2008,4,I liked these... I used celery seed in place of celery only because certain family members cannot chew it... and used onion powder also.  I also added a little sprinkle of garlic powder just be...
12/16/2007,4,I thought it was a bit too crunchy for my taste. Next time I will put the onion gradually.
11/23/2007,4,Very good and super easy.  I decreased the mayo by a touch added a teeny bit of mustard and some horseradish for some added kick.  Really enjoyed these thanks!
11/22/2007,4,this is great! minimized the mayo a bit and added spice brown mustard.  Added a bit of baking splenda to make it sweet.  Yummy!
10/18/2007,4,Turned out well except that I used celery salt instead of celery since that's what I had already. I didn't taste it before adding more regular salt therefore it turned out a bit saltier than ...
7/6/2007,4,This was really good. I will use a lot more hot sauze next time though. A dash really isn't enough for a spicy flavor. I really liked the crunchiness though.
4/8/2007,4,Yummy but I am more accustomed to deviled eggs with a bit more tang.  Normally I'd use Miracle Whip but I didn't want to deviate from the recipe since hot sauce is used.  Still very tasty tho...
4/4/2007,4,These were very good.  I added 1 tabelspoon of dijon mustard & garnish with bacon bits.
4/3/2007,4,This was an excellent deviled egg.  I didn't think it was much different or more special than the other very good ones I've had but it was definitely worthy of sharing at a potluck brunch.  The...
1/11/2007,4,This is a great recipe. I substituted 1/4 cup mustard for half of the mayo since my husband isn't big on mayonaise and it came out bril.
12/3/2006,4,These were good but I thought the onion flavor was a little strong for me.  They did get eaten up at my party however so maybe I'm just not a big fan of onions.  The celery gave it a nice crun...
11/6/2006,4,Very good. And I had all of the ingredients in my kitchen! Loved the addition of the hot sauce.
11/3/2006,4,These were great!  I loved the crunch and flavor that the celery and onion added.  I also really liked the hot sauce in it though I added quite a bit more than a dash because I liked the kick....

12/20/2005,4,This was ok.  It is a little bland as is.  Adding sweet pickled relish and yellow mustard improved the taste.  Thanks.
12/4/2005,4,Great but too a tad too onion-y.  Also I like more of a vinegar taste. Very good though and everyone doted over them.
1/24/2005,4,These were really good.  However I took out the celery b/c it watered it down too much and I added mustard and parsely and a bit more hot sauce.
4/11/2004,4,These were very good! I ended up adding a little dijon mustard and a little extra celery  but the recipe was good just as written also.  Thanks for the recipe. :)
4/18/2003,4,These were great and easy to do.  My son loves them and he is only 8.
11/4/2001,4,These were great!
7/26/2001,4,Very good alternative to mustard or plain!
5/20/2001,4,I'm not an egg fan but I made these for Easter and they got rave reviews so I tried one....not bad!
4/15/2001,4,Delicious Devield Eggs!!!
1/10/2016,3,A little bland.
11/28/2015,3,I usually like the egg filling a little bit thicker. The flavors were good. I added garlic and onion powder as well.
7/3/2013,3,This recipe was just okay. I took it to a party and everyone ate them but thought they were bland. Some didn't like the crunch. I am still looking for a better recipe.
5/29/2012,3,Good flavor but almost too much crunch in the texture with the celery and onion for me.  Guess I like my eggs more creamy than crunchy.
4/11/2012,3,They were ok.  I liked the crunch from the celery and onion but it needed a little mustard (ground) which I added.
1/10/2012,3,I used green onion as that is what I had on hand.  I substituted fat free plain yogurt for the mayo to cut down on calories.  These were really just ok for us.  Pretty bland.  Probably 2 stars f...
9/7/2011,3,not a fan of these. the spice was nice but I am used to a more basic deviled egg recipe.  I never use onion or celery- and now I know I prefer it that way.   Was worth a try and allowed a nice p...

1/22/2011,3,They were ok but didn't wow me. I actually ended up adding other things to the mix to give them a little kick. I added garden onions in with the celery and I added some spicy brown mustard and ...
12/31/2010,3,These were good.  I like the crunch of the celery and onion however it still lacked flavor.
7/12/2010,3,Followed the recipe as is and didn't find it overly unique.  Too much celery for sure. I'll stick to other recipes.
4/9/2010,3,I doubled the recipe because I had 11 eggs. So I used half an onion.  It was awful.  The mix was very runny and the taste of onion was overpowering.  This may also be because I pulsed the onion ...
4/6/2010,3,These were good but were very plain - was expecting better
2/8/2010,3,These were okay; a tad bit bland and I definitely did not care for the chopped onion. Will try again with more black pepper and cayenne and perhaps a touch of mustard.
4/16/2009,3,I rated the recipe as is because I felt it was lacking the mustard flavor I tend to love in deviled eggs!  The hot sauce and crunchy bits were a hit but the eggs definitely needed mustard to ma...
4/14/2009,3,Great for the person who wants something other than the traditional deviled egg. The onion and celery are really powerful and adds lots of texture.
3/31/2009,3,I agree its alittle bland...so I ususally add a dash of pickle juice and  garlic salt and a dash of vanilla and dash of mustard or dijon ..the best! Never had any complaints yet!
3/29/2009,3,Just OK...I will NOT make these again I guess I'm just a sweet relish deviled egg kind of girl.
2/1/2009,3,This one is not for us-as others said- this would make a great egg salad.  I ended up adding some curry powder to it.
11/26/2008,3,I made these tonight and after sampling the mixture I realized the onion is way too much. My kids won't eat this because of it. I did use white onion which may have been a mistake. I had to add...
11/26/2008,3,This is a truly fabulous recipe for egg salad (cut up egg whites too) but I liked it considerably less for deviled eggs.  It turned out quite runny:  one change I would make is to add part of ...
1/20/2008,3,These tasted fine but it took some getting used to the crunch of the celery and onion in the yolk mixture.  The splash of hot sauce was a nice touch though.
6/26/2007,3,PRetty good but found the mixture a little too runny.
5/11/2007,3,I followed the recipe exactly and was disappointed.  The onion flavor was too strong for my family.
12/3/2006,3,The flavor was fine but I didn't care for crunchy bits in my deviled eggs. I used Miracle Whip instead of mayo. The hot sauce was a nice touch.
4/15/2006,3,These are good. I like the hot sauce in them and put way more than called for.  I think that was my husbands favorite part as well.  I am a purist also though and did not prefer the texture of t...
12/12/2004,3,These were OK my mom's are a lot better.
1/28/2004,3,As it is this recipe is far too bland for me.  It would make a good foundation if you like to play with ways of doctoring it to suit yourself.
12/25/2014,2,It was easy to do but still lack some flavor.
12/1/2014,2,Bland if followed as written.  Def needs mustard or/and relish.
9/9/2012,2,Way too much onion...added relish and mustard to overcome.
2/9/2012,2,I don't get all the rave reviews.  I found the eggs edible but there wasn't the depth of flavor I enjoy in the recipes with mustard in the ingredients.  My kids loved it but I won't be making ...
4/25/2011,2,Disappointing. After so many great reviews I was expecting a much more tasty result.  The flavor was bland.  Couldn't taste anything but onion.  I had to add way more hot sauce than in the reci...
2/6/2011,2,Good but needs more zing. Maybe add mustard
1/10/2011,2,Very oniony.
9/26/2010,2,Not much flavor.  I added a slice of cherry tomatoe to the top and added some drops of the hot pepper sauce to the top because the filling was tasteless.
4/8/2010,2,I really didn't like these because of the onion and I missed the vinegar to give it the tanginess I love!!
4/4/2010,2,These were good but not great.  they tasted good -more like potato salad than a deviled egg.  Overall I didn't care for the lumpy texture of the yolk mixture (perhaps I didn't mash them well eno...
1/28/2009,2,This is nice fancy egg salad but a deviled egg?  I don't think so.  Sorry.
6/7/2008,2,I liked the crunch of the onion and celery but overall these were a bit too bland for my tastes.
5/31/2008,2,The onion is too over powering. Even when its finely chopped.
3/2/2008,2,I was really surprised by this.  I thought the recipe sounded good but didn't pull it off.  I found the celery and onion added texture but not much flavor at all.  I usually add Claussen Dill ...
3/26/2013,1,Very bland going to try another recipie.
7/23/2011,1,This recipe is not very good. The onion is just not a good addition to the recipe.
4/23/2011,1,NOT GOOD. I was really looking forward to trying this recipe since it had so many good reviews. I followed the recipe exactly chopped the onion and celery very fine. It was bland yet onion-y. S...
4/1/2011,1,The onion made these made these totally unedible.  My onions were sharp and they overwhelmed the yolk mixture.  I still have nothing but onion flavor in my mouth after just tasting the stuff. If...
1/2/2011,1,I tried to like them but both my husband and I thought they were not worth the effort to tweak. I'll just go back to the old one I was using.
1/1/2011,1,Sorry Di but I hated the addition of the celery and onion.  I wanted to make sure they were chopped finely so I put them in my mini processor and it was still too crunchy.  I followed the reci...
4/2/2009,1,i did not enjoy this recipe . Im so sorry. i use black olives and a little relish and of course the basics.mayo and mustard.
4/19/2008,1,WAAAAY Too much onion and celery!
3/22/2008,1,i didn't care for this recipe at all. i had to triple for an Easter recipe and ended up with too much onion. we cut the final product in half an added another cup of mayo to even out the taste.
9/9/2003,1,Pretty much flavorless even with the hot sauce. However I did enjoy the added texture of the minced onion and celery. I'll stick to my own recipe in the future but add the onion and celery to...
3/24/2005,5,This is an excellent recipe as you can tell from the positive reviews.  It does make ALOT but it freezes really well!  I froze it in individual servings and my husband took it for lunch and LO...
3/23/2005,5,My husband groaned when I said we were having baked ziti... but he devoured this one!  It was even better the next day as leftovers.
3/23/2005,5,I needed a quick recipe for an Italian club meeting and thought I would try this.  I tripled the recipe (for 24) and used a roasting pan it was still very easy to put together.  The members lov...
3/22/2005,5,great recipe! I just made it for my boyfriend and he absolutely loved it!
3/22/2005,5,The beauty of this recipe is that it is so easy. It's not gourmet cuisine but you can alter it just about any way you want to suit your taste and it still turns out. You can change the cheeses...
3/22/2005,5,I made this for our housewarming party last weekend and it was gone in an hour!  Everyone loved it!  In fact my family has requested that I make it again next weekend for easter!The only thing ...
3/21/2005,5,Excellent recipe...I added 2 cloves of garlic minced and ricotta cheese...also used hot turkey sausage instead of ground beef for a little kick. Everyone loved it!
3/20/2005,5,"I didn't have any provolone so I mixed the sour cream with about 1 cup of ricotta and some chopped fresh chives.  All 3 of my kids had seconds and that is remarkable.

Great recipe!!!!"
3/20/2005,5,Fantastic recipe!  We were short on mozarella and added some ricotta!  GREAT!
3/20/2005,5,A wonderful dish. Would say it serves more than 8 with a salad.  I do layer the sauce over the pasta as suggested by others.
3/19/2005,5,terrific...everyone loves it. I give this recipe out all the time.
3/19/2005,5,Delicious!!
3/17/2005,5,Everyone raved about this ziti.  My husband absolutely loved it.
3/17/2005,5,Wow just wow.  Everyone absolutely loved this even though I messed up!  Always make sure that you use the right sized pan!  Otherwise messes are made while having it overflow (it stayed prett...
3/16/2005,5,SUCH a keeper! Easy and so delicious. I seasoned the meat with italian seasoning and garlic powder. Used half a small tub of ricotta mixed with entire (small) container of sour cream and 8 oz s...
3/16/2005,5,Yum! Yum! Yum! This was awesome! I'd had it before in resturants so I decided to suprise my boyfriend with a super good homecooked meal. This turned out great. I halved the recipe but not the m...
3/16/2005,5,This is so good and so simple to make.  With a family of 5 I can make this every week and it's gone usually in a day or two at the most.
3/10/2005,5,I made this for dinner last night and my family really liked it so this is a family favorite from now on.
3/10/2005,5,This recipe is great.  It tastes like the baked ziti at my favorite local Italian restaurant.  I used homemade sauce and a mixture of sour cream and ricotta cheese.  My family will be enjoying t...
3/6/2005,5,I haven't been a baked ziti fan but this recipe made me change my tune.  Usually the ziti is a little too dry for my taste but this recipe was just right.  The only change was I used a bit more ...
3/6/2005,5,This is great! I used 1/2 lb. ground beef and 1/2 lb. hot italian sausage. Instead of the store bought marinara I used the recipe I found on this site for The Best Marinara Sauce Yet. It was a...
3/5/2005,5,"This is a very good recipe - good solid Italian
comfort food that everybody loves!  We have 
made it probably half a dozen times - sometimes
just for ourselves and sometimes for our families...."
3/4/2005,5,My husband thinks this dish is fantastic. He begs me to make it for him. I usually half the recipe and it still makes a lot of food.
3/4/2005,5,This was great! Made it for my family and parents everyone loved it. It makes a lot too we had a week's worth of work lunches left over.
3/3/2005,5,QUICK!! DELICIOUS!! Even better than Lasagna.  This is a keeper.  I even used 1/2 of the sour cream and 1/2 of the sauce.  I used low fat ingredients. I also rinsed off the beef put garlic in it...
3/2/2005,5,SOOO easy to make and fabulous!  I didn't have Ziti noodles nor provolone cheese so I modified with  using spiral noodles and additional mozerella cheese in place of Provolone. I used ground tur...
3/2/2005,5,Delicious great company dish i've made it with ziti and with penne.  I've used half sour cream and the other half as cottage cheese and once as ricotta cheese. I've also made it all sour cream...
3/2/2005,5,This was really wonderful.  We health-ed it up using whole wheat pasta and adding veggies to the sauce. The best part?  My kids ate it right up and wanted more!  Definately a keeper recipe.
3/2/2005,5,I recently found out my 14 month old is allergic to eggs-so my own tried and true baked ziti recipe is out. I made this last night and it was wonderful. I didn't have ground beef so I chopped up...
3/1/2005,5,"This recipe is excellent!  Rather than buttering the bottom of the pan I spread enough sauce to cover the bottom.  I also only used approximately
32 ounces of sauce in the recipe."
3/1/2005,5,My family enjoyed this it made a lot so I split it with my neighbor. Next time I'll use 2 smaller pans as suggested. Substituted the sour cream for ricotta and sauted garlic with the hamburger....

2/25/2005,5,This was much better then a previous recipe used (will eat the leftovers vs throwing them out). Only added garlic while browning meat and onions. A keeper for sure.
2/25/2005,5,Excellent and easy recipe. *Do* use the sour cream -- made for a great consistency. Due to cost I used only mozarella cheese and it turned out perfect. Plus I used a combination of hot Italia...
2/24/2005,5,This recipe is SO simple and turns out delicious every time! I cook it without the meat and usually divide it into two smaller casseroles. You can freeze this (unbaked) for an easy meal on a bu...

2/13/2005,5,How can you not love this ziti recipe? The mixes of cheese are really good. I made this 5 hours ahead of time and let the dish sit in the refrigerator to blend. I used a block of mozzarella and ...
2/9/2005,5,Another family pleasing recipe. The only change I would make is to half it if you have a small family.
2/9/2005,5,I too used sausage instead of beef Italian shredded cheese instead of provolone and added another 1/2 cup of sour cream.  DELICIOUS!!!
2/7/2005,5,Great recipe!  I used a jar of Barilla spagetti sauce with olives.  Extra yummy.  Next time I'll add another 1/2# of meat.
2/7/2005,5,Other than using mini penne I always make this just as the recipes states.  My boys will eat this several nights within a week and never complain.  One of their all-time favorite dinners.
2/6/2005,5,As suggested by other reviewers used ricotta instead of sour cream.  For bottled sauce used Classico Tomato and Basil.  We also used about 3/4 pound of ziti and it fit into the 9x11 fine.  Gre...
2/2/2005,5,Great recipe! Very easy to make and has great flavor... I might recommend using a 4 quart dish as there just wasn't enough room in the 9x13.

12/26/2004,5,UPDATED REVIEW - I tried this again last night and I have to say it was awesome this time!  I did add hot Italian sausage to the meat mixture this time and it made a world of difference for us...
12/21/2004,5,I LOVE THIS DISH!!  And so does everyone else I've served it to.  The only thing I changed was the order of the layers I didn't like the meat sauce mixture on top.
12/21/2004,5,Ive tried my share of ziti recipes for my family and this one is the best so far. My 9yr old came home from school the day after we ate it and wanted it for an afterschool snack.
12/20/2004,5,Made this for a holiday potluck and it was a big hit.  As suggested I used ricotta cheese in place of sour cream for a creamer flavor and I used spicy sausage instead of beef. Next time I will ...

12/17/2004,5,"LOVE THIS DISH!!!

12/8/2004,5,Three words describe this ziti - YUM YUM YUM!  This recipe is great. I used ground pork instead of ground beef and next time I will probably add some chopped garlic with the meat & chopped ...

3/28/2004,5,Very good VERY cheesy!  The other reviews were right. It's almost impossible to fit all of the ingredients into one 9x13 dish. I just didn't use all the noodles and sauce.  I also left off the ...
3/25/2004,5,Reminds me of the American Lasagna recipe except it takes less time to make. I'll use a larger pan next time though seeing as I could hardly fit everything into the one I had. Very deliciou...

3/16/2004,5,Soooo good and soooo easy!  The only change I made was I used 3/4 cup sour cream and 3/4 cup ricotta cheese I'm sure it would have been great with just sour cream though too!  Definately not fo...
3/16/2004,5,I used 1 lb. of sweet italian sausage instead of the groud beef - only because my family LOVES italian sausage.  I've made if both ways and they are both FAB!

3/1/2004,5,My husband and his family are Italian and only eat home-made italian food. I used the jar sauce and ground sausage instead of beef and this was a smash. I never got so many compliments. This is ...
3/1/2004,5,I absolutely love this recipe!  It is very easy to make and freezes well.  I always use a meat substitute.  I swear by the Morning Star brand which keeps the same consistency as ground beef.  T...

2/1/2004,5,An excellent recipe that is exceptionally easy to make!!!
1/30/2004,5,This is now my most requested potluck recipe.  It is the best version of baked ziti I've ever tasted. I think it's the sour cream.

1/13/2004,5,This turned out fantastic!  I am not a fan of ricotta cheese so this looked good to me.  Hubby is a HUGE fan of baked ziti and he actually has declared this his favorite recipe I have tried!  ...
1/11/2004,5,We love this recipie.  I do use ricotta cheese mixed with one egg instead of sour cream. I makes alot I usually divided it to make two casseroles and freeze one for later. Thanks!
1/9/2004,5,This pasta dish is so easy and very very tasty.  I used whole wheat pasta and unless I told you you wouldn't know it was whole wheat - the cheese and tomato flavors really take over!  Sure to...

11/13/2003,5,This was excellent. My 8 yr old daughter and I made it together and we didn't follow the directions very well.  I mixed the pasta and sauce by accident. I put 1/2 on the bottom of the pan then l...

12/10/2002,5,This dish is delicious!  I love lasagna but I think this tasted just as good as lasagna but easier to make!  Since it made so much I had left overs for the next 3 days which I didn't mind at all...
12/7/2002,5,My husband doesn't usually like casseroles especially those that are the least bit creamy.  He ate thirds!  This is a keeper.  I love being able to put it together while the baby's asleep too.
12/5/2002,5,"I've made this ziti recipe a dozen times and every single time there's not
piece of pasta left in the pan.  And who cares about the fat and calories
it's awesome and easy!"

10/25/2002,5,This is a great recipe.  I am a vegetarian so I left the meat (and also the onions) out and the result was excellent.  I tried others' suggestions of putting the sauce directly on top of the pa...
10/25/2002,5,Very good. Thank you for sharing Colleen. The taste is very similar to my Lasagna. I believe I like the Lasagna noodles better than the Ziti macaroni though.
10/25/2002,5,This was delicious. My boyfriend liked it even better then lasagna. I cut the recipe in half and used a 2 qt casserole dish. I used rotini pasta instead of ziti and cheddar instead of provolone...

10/8/2002,5,A HUGE hit with my 17-year old son.  I used bulk Italian sausage instead of ground beef for a little extra flavor.  Like lasagne only not as heavy and the sour cream adds a nice zing to it.

9/28/2002,5,Because I was catering my brothers party I decided to make this with the addition of ricotta cheese and going meatless. The sour cream gave it a nice tang and the provolone cheese was a welcome...

3/22/2000,5,Really good!  The recipe makes more than I need at one time so I divide the recipe between two  1 1/2 qt casserole dishes.  Freezes well!  Good choice for casual company!

3/20/2000,5,The recipe is excellent and extremely easy.  Perfect for company.

4/25/2009,5,Fantastic guacamole! Some of the best I have ever had!!
4/25/2009,5,Excellent recipe. The most important thing is to make sure you get good ripe avocadoes (which is especially difficult for us in the Midwest). If you do that this recipe comes out perfectly.
4/24/2009,5,This is for sure the best guac recipe out there.  I used to think my guac was the best and have always used lime juice which is key but have now made this 3 times and receive rave reviews eve...

4/8/2009,5,Delicious..Had it with chicken tacos and used it on the tacos and for dipping tortilla chips. A big hit with the kids too!
4/7/2009,5,Yummy! The only change I made was I used only 1/2 of a tomato. The garlic-lime-cilantro combo really make this guac great.
4/6/2009,5,This recipe has served as a good guide for me to know what should go into a guac.  I use about 1 Tb chopped onion 2 cloves garlic and left out the tomato (not in season here) and blended it al...

4/3/2009,5,I was craving Guacamole from a local restaurant and decided to make it myself. I just happened to have everything needed for this recipe. OMG it was soooo good.   The one thing I did do is scr...
4/2/2009,5,Oh man. Avocado has always been a staple in my diet and this is my favorite guacamole recipe. I like it a little chunky and I almost always use red onion instead of yellow or white.
3/31/2009,5,I have made GUAC for many many years...just by memory or whatever I had on hand.  I decided to follow a recipe and HOLY GUACAMOLE - this is perfect.
3/31/2009,5,Bomb! We cut out half the lime so I can taste the guac more. Made it twice so far good easy recipe.
3/27/2009,5,I made this when my chef-caliber family came over for Mother's Day.  I've been asked to bring it on countless occasions since then.  I do the whole thing in a food processor but reserve one coa...

3/23/2009,5,I love this guacamole! Thanks for this awesome recipe :)
3/22/2009,5,Great recipe.  Here is a small addition for some heat... mince half to a whole jalapeno and mash (with the back of a spoon) together with the onions cilantro garlic before adding the avocados....
3/22/2009,5,This is a wonderful recipe and can be adjusted to the chef's liking!
3/22/2009,5,Yum!

3/20/2009,5,Excellent version of this wonderful treat! This is just like I make only I use tomatillos instead of roma tomatoes. I also add a little fresh jalapeno for heat. Oh no please never the powdered...
3/15/2009,5,Best guacamole my boyfriend and I have have had. The only thing I left out was onions. Not a big fan of them. Absolutely wonderful!!

3/13/2009,5,I didnt change anything! I like mine a little chunky so I used a pastry cutter and stopped when I got to the consistancy of my liking. This is the best guacamole I have ever had. Thanks
3/13/2009,5,guacamole doesn't get any better than this!
3/13/2009,5,Absolutely Amazing!  I made a double batch for 8 people and was left with less than a cup.  Even those who don't normally like guacamole were chowing it down.  I made the recipe as called and pu...

2/17/2009,5,Phenomenal! Only tweaks I made for our personal taste were: more lime juice because we like the zing white pepper and ground cumin. We live in Hawaii so Avocados are plentiful and will be maki...

2/9/2009,5,Perfectly delicious!!  Thank you!!

2/2/2009,5,Hands down the best I ever tasted. Thanks!
2/2/2009,5,Excellent recipe however next time I will use green or red onions instead. My store was also out of fresh cilantro so 1 used 1tbs of dried and it was great but will be even better with fresh.
2/2/2009,5,If ever a recipe deserved 5 stars this is it. I've made it few times and again yesterday for Super Bowl to rave reviews. And I'm not crazy about onion and my husband is not crazy about tomatoe...
2/2/2009,5,YUM! I made this for our superbowl party and it was the best guac i've ever had! My husband is not a big fan of guacamole usually and ate a ton of it! It reminds me of chipotle's guac...I'll be ...
2/2/2009,5,Taste great.  Error proof.
2/1/2009,5,Wonderful!  I do however use flat leaf parsley and a bit of tony's.  Will make again and again!
2/1/2009,5,I make this all the time and it's fabulous!  We add a little more cilantro...my relatives always want me to bring this to family gatherings.
2/1/2009,5,Incredibly simple and tastiest guac ever!  I travel to Mexico on business a lot and this is even better than a lot of guac I have down there.
2/1/2009,5,Amazingly delish! Made for company last night and they loved it.  I'm making it again today we just didn't have enough of it.  So easy to make.  I've made guac before and was very disappointed...
2/1/2009,5,This is a keeper for the best guacamole ever.I made a batch 6 months ago and I should have rated it at that time with 5+ stars.  I lost my recipe and had trouble fing it again here.  Today my se...
2/1/2009,5,I used this recipe as a general guide and the result was awesome! Didn't include the cayenne pepper and I doubled the recipe. This was my first time making guacamole and it turned out so well I...
2/1/2009,5,I'd like to give this more than 5 stars.  I've made this several times and it always comes out so so so so good!
2/1/2009,5,To prevent the avocadoes from browning peel them and put them into some water with ice in it. Let them sit in there while you chop your cilantro tomatoes and onions and whatever else you add. ...
2/1/2009,5,I can't lose with this recipe. It's so easy and always a crowd pleaser. The citrus has an awesome kick - especially when combined with the cayenne pepper and jalapenos. Don't miss out on this yu...
1/31/2009,5,Yum!!! and very easy to make.
1/30/2009,5,I must say this took a lot of work! However it was definitely worth it. I find it not necessary to make any alterations on this recipe. If you like chunky guacamole this is the perfect recipe...
1/30/2009,5,YUMBO! I like a chunkier guac so I didn't mash the avocados as much but this was so tasty! great recipe!
1/30/2009,5,I made this recipe exactly as called for except I ommitted the ceyenne pepper.  It was delicious!  My husband and I both loved it!
1/29/2009,5,This was my first time making guacamole. This came out great! I will be using this recipe again. Thank you.
1/29/2009,5,great recipe!  i much rather it fresh than store bought.  i did spice it up alot though.  more cayenne little tabasco and some Tony's.  overall i loved it!!!! thanks
1/29/2009,5,I've made this recipe at least 30 times and it's the best guacamole in my book! Awesome recipe! Thanks for sharing!
1/29/2009,5,I make this guacamole frequently and it is always quickly devoured. I toss all of the ingredients into my stand mixer and blend until desired chunkiness. I use ½ t of salt and usually omit the ...
1/29/2009,5,Excellent!!!  I put everything in the food processor but the tomatoes.  So smooth and creamy and the bite of chopped tomatoes really made it the best ever.  My husband actually licked the bowl! ...
1/28/2009,5,This was my first time making guacamole. I saw and reviewed all the ratings but I didn't expect this to be SO GREAT! I was not let down. I am very picky about my guac and this was divine. I have...
1/28/2009,5,Best Guacamole ever.
1/28/2009,5,As good as restaurant guac. Have made this many times always delicious and very flexible. I highly recommend using a food processor. After processing all other ingredientsadd the tomatoes(quar...
1/27/2009,5,delicious followed the recipe exactly and it was great!
1/26/2009,5,super good! i always substitute rotel tomatoes with green chilies for the roma tomatoes. gives it more spice.
1/26/2009,5,okay a bit longer than 10 minute prep but who cares this tastes really delicious i am going to use more cayenne next time and also maybe some cumin because so many reviewers had recommended ...
1/26/2009,5,Very good recipe! Made double batch half went into a 7 layer dip the other was set for it's own dip! Was gone by the end of the evening! Thank you :)
1/25/2009,5,The second time making guacamole but first time with this recipe...very nice...altered it with cumin and fresh lime with chopped cilantro!
1/25/2009,5,Holy Guacamole!  This is good stuff!
1/25/2009,5,I substituted garlic powder in place of the minced garlic and it was very delicious!
1/25/2009,5,We really liked this.  I used a few dashes of Tobasco Sauce instead of the Cayenne Pepper.
1/25/2009,5,Everyone loved this recipe!! just amazing!
1/25/2009,5,Excellent flavor and tastes very fresh - this is THE BEST guac recipe I have found to date!
1/18/2009,5,Delicious. I have made this several times and it turns out best when the tomatoes are chopped and separated from the juice. Adding in the juice from the inside of the tomato makes it too runny.
1/16/2009,5,Never found another recipe that can come close to this one. Thanks!
1/13/2009,5,This was great. I made it for a get together and I got good reviews. I used garlic powder instead of minced and I just kindof started adding more garlic and cayenne to a preferred taste. No more...
1/12/2009,5,Fantastic and easy. Highly recommend.
1/12/2009,5,Perfect! Next time I will use 3 large avacados instead of the 3 small that I had. I may add a 4th avacado just for extra taste. Best recipe. I wont be using any other! Thank you!
1/10/2009,5,This is the perfect Guacamole!  I used regular vine tomatos and extra garlic.  I can't wait to make it again!!!
1/9/2009,5,Good quick and easy!
1/9/2009,5,this was AWESOME!!! I thought it even tasted better than the guac i've had at a lot of mexican restaurants. i make this whenever I am making quesadillas for dinner and it is a huge hit. The only...
1/7/2009,5,Loved this.  The flavor was so fresh!  Will definitely make again...and again...and again...
1/4/2009,5,Soooooo goood! I've taken it to parties and always get compliments. No other guacamole will do!
1/3/2009,5,Super good i put a little extra lime in mine and it still came out great.
1/3/2009,5,This is the best guacamole! I make it almost once a week for my fiance. People that usually don't like guacamole love it too! It's always a hit and it's healthy!
1/3/2009,5,Great Recipe! This is the only one I will use from now on!
12/31/2008,5,Good consistency and flavour was a big hit!

12/29/2008,5,Holy cow this is outstanding.  I made it for every camping trip this summer and it was ALWAYS gone!  Along side some beer margaritas from this site and that's all you need for an afternoon of ...

12/26/2008,5,Yum!  This is truly the best guac I have ever made.  My boyfriend HATES guacamole but he LOVES this recipe.  He actually suggests it now as something for us to bring to family get togethers!  I...
12/25/2008,5,great recipe!  followed it exactly and it came out amazing!
12/23/2008,5,Love it! I made a double batch for a Christmas get-together. I altered it a little by using one big regular tomato chili powder instead of cayenne because I didn't have any and lemon juice ins...
12/20/2008,5,Yummy Yummy Yummy!
12/18/2008,5,This was my first time making this recipe and my boyfriend and I completely loved it. One thing I do suggest is to add the lime juice to your taste because mine ended up a little sour. All in a...
12/16/2008,5,Always a hit at parties! I do buy an extra lime and squeeze it over the top and mix it in RIGHT before serving. Tastes nice and fresh. Thanks for the great recipe!
12/16/2008,5,Amazing.
12/16/2008,5,Everyone loved it! It was gone within minutes! I will make this again!
12/9/2008,5,This was great.  I chopped everything the night before and then smashed up the avacado right beforehand so that it wouldn't turn brown.  The guacamole was actually better the next day.  Had grea...
12/8/2008,5,Wow this is good! Made exactly as recipe stated and we chowed through the entire bowl in one sitting (and wanted more!). =)
12/8/2008,5,So good and so easy!  I increased the cilantro and lime juice to my taste and it was delish!
12/7/2008,5,Great recipe!  Made some changes though.  Used a can of diced tomatoes in cilantro and lime juice rather than cutting up tomatoes and cilantro.  Tasted great.  Everyone loved it!
12/5/2008,5,This was very good. I would cut back on the lime but other then that it was wonderful and my Co-Workers loved it!
12/5/2008,5,I love this recipe because it's chunky!  Fresh white onions are amazing.  I double the cayenne pepper to make it more spicy.
12/4/2008,5,The BEST guacamole I've ever had
12/3/2008,5,The best!!
12/3/2008,5,This is a great recipe we added some cumin as others mentioned and only half the lime it was overwhelming at first but after sitting in the fridge it melded with the other flavors. Added a bit...
11/30/2008,5,Used a little less garlic - everyone at the party loved it.
11/27/2008,5,This guacamole is delicious! By far the best I've ever had and it was so easy to make. Took as an appetizer for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit. Followed the recipe exactly minus the cayenne ...
11/24/2008,5,Amazing.  I am a nut for guacamole and this is the best recipe I have ever tasted.  It's not necessary to follow the measurements just throw your stuff in to taste.  I prefer a chunkier guac s...

11/15/2008,5,I love guacamole but had never made it before because I thought it would be really time consuming.  This recipe took under 10 minutes to make and was delicious!  Just make sure your avocados are...

11/14/2008,5,Absolutely delicious!!! I LOVE guacamole and I thought that this recipe was the BOMB.  I blended the ingredients in my mini-foodprocessor and it turned out great.  I served atop chicken fajitas ...
11/14/2008,5,"Fantastic recipe!

After trying this many times I liked it best with 1/3 cup onion and 1 tbsp of garlic.  I don't like cilantro so I dropped it.  Cayenne to taste and salt until the avocado fla..."
11/14/2008,5,Nothing to change. SIMPLY THE BEST!

11/1/2008,5,This is the BEST guacamole I have ever had!  Better than any Mexican restaurant I've been to.  I make this as is but I use a red onion and a little extra minced garlic.  AMAZING!
10/31/2008,5,Made this for a party I was going to and my children liked it so much I had to make another patch. Love IT
10/22/2008,5,Delicious!  The cilantro gave it the extra kick I was looking for.
10/22/2008,5,This is definitely my favorite Guacamole. I leave my avocado in chunks and used red onion. Always a hit at my house.
10/22/2008,5,WOW!  I only had one and a half avocadoes and the recipe STILL came out great!  Add more onion garlic and/or cayenne (or chipotle!) to make it spicier.  THANK YOU!
10/19/2008,5,The best guacamole ever! I made two batches for a party - one for cilantro lovers like myself and one for those who hate cilantro like my boyfriend. I was surprised to see that cilantro-haters ...
10/18/2008,5,Simply the best guacamole. Not a thing needs changing.

10/13/2008,5,This is awesome.  I was told if you leave the pits in the dip it'll keep the green color longer.
10/13/2008,5,Wonderful! Its like pico de gallo with avocado. I added some fresh minced jalapeno and a couple of dashes of hot pepper sauce. We've decided we like this chunky guacamole so much better than the...
10/12/2008,5,My husband said it was the best guacamole he'd ever had!  And now he asks me to make it ALL.THE.TIME!
10/10/2008,5,Normally my husband and I would pick up guacamole at Whole Foods market and bring it to get togethers but I decided to attempt to make guacamole myself.  My hubby thought it was even better t...

10/8/2008,5,This was Amazing and gone in about 5 seconds!!!  My husband LOVED it and so did I.  Thank you for a great keeper recipe.
10/8/2008,5,Next time I will add more spice to it...but everyone at my party enjoyed it nonetheless!
10/7/2008,5,I know it doesn't need anymore reviews but this was better than any guacamole I've ever had before. I added about twice as much cilantro and I couldn't get enough!
10/6/2008,5,The best guacamole!
10/4/2008,5,So yummy!
10/4/2008,5,Sensational! I always wanted to make my own Guacamole for the purpose of fresh taste and I was never a great Dip maker. Well Made this one tonight for a party of 6 and it was a HUGE HIT! Than...
10/3/2008,5,AMAZING!! It was the first time I've made guacamole from scratch and this recipe is sooo good and easy!
10/1/2008,5,Ohhhhhhh yeah.  I only had one big avocado so I kind of eyeballed some of the ingredients after scaling the recipe down to 2 servings but woooooowwwww.....that's excellent stuff.  I also reduced...
10/1/2008,5,Great recipe but don't be fooled by the serving size. I had to double the recipe for 4 people. I also added cumin which added great flavor. The garlic was really key in this guac recipe. It did...
10/1/2008,5,Perfect!
9/27/2008,5,Good guac.  I really like the tomatillos - adds nice texture.
9/26/2008,5,Excellent!  I always used to make my own fresh guac with just avocado lime and salt--but this recipe was so much better!  Really amazing flavors--my entire family loved it.
9/24/2008,5,Excellent I use a jalapeno instead of cayenne and omit the salt (plenty on the chips:)) Yum
9/23/2008,5,HOLY GUACAMOLE!!!  This was awesome.  I am a big fan of guacamole and had never made it before until now.  This was even tastier than Chipotle's guac (which I thought was the best until now).  E...
9/22/2008,5,I could take or leave guacamole before but this recipe turned me into a guacamole lover. You won't be able to stop eating this! I think the lime and cilantro are key to the flavor.
9/22/2008,5,I have made this guacamole six times since the 4th of July and every time I get rave reviews.  I go easier on the tomato since I don't think they add a whole lot.
9/21/2008,5,I never made guacamole before and followed this recipe exactly -- it was so good!  The only addition I made due to other reviews was a clove of garlic.  I couldn't stop eating it.  Thanks for th...

9/21/2008,5,I'm extremely picky about guacamole and my favorite restaurant is over an hour away.  So when I recently had a craving I searched this site for recipes.  I came across a few that sounded good...
9/18/2008,5,Delicious and so easy to make! I used a little less salt about half the amount because it tasted a little too salty before I chilled it. After standing in the fridge for about 3 hours the salt...
9/17/2008,5,Awesome!!! I made this for a class I was doing with teenagers. All of them said at the beginning of class they did not live avocados. After we made this every one of them liked this and said th...
9/14/2008,5,A must have recipe in your cookbook! Very nice blend of flavors and texture. I substituted fresh cilantro for dried since I didn't have fresh cilantro. I also reduced the amount of tomato by ha...
9/14/2008,5,This is the best guacamole I've ever tasted! I followed the recipe exactly and was absolutely thrilled. I highly recommend cayenne pepper as a necessary ingredient and not an option.
9/10/2008,5,Great one!!
9/10/2008,5,Absolutely the best. I am asked to bring this dish for every family get together! Love it!
9/9/2008,5,Best Fresh Guacamole Recipe Evah!
9/8/2008,5,This is the first time I have ever had guacamole and I love it. My husband asks me to make this often! Thanks so much
9/7/2008,5,"This is a great recipe! Although it probably would be better if you use a real lime I used lime juice from a bottle and if you do use it from a bottle only use about 1/8 cup.
This tastes grea..."
9/7/2008,5,Magnificent recipe!!! :) The blend of onion and garlic with the avacado flavor is so amazing! I made a packet guacamole one time before this... never again! It was a complete waste of an avacado...
9/7/2008,5,This is sooo yummy.  Up until this recipe I never liked quacamole.  I use a lot of cayenne for that extra kick!
9/7/2008,5,Excellent. Used in layered tortilla dip and served to Parisians (this is not something they see) and they cleaned the platter.
9/6/2008,5,Great recipe easy fast and great tasting.  I didn't change anything and served it to my husband and sons.  It was gone before I sat down.
9/4/2008,5,Very easy and tasty.  I use regular pepper and a dash of hot sauce.
9/2/2008,5,LOVE this recipe! I've made this a few times already and I've come to conclusion that I like to add additional garlic.  Extra garlic is always good. YUM
9/2/2008,5,Made it chunky - this was way better than our vetted family recipe! (But I won't tell them..he he)
9/2/2008,5,This is excellent. Since cilantro seems to be the love/hate herb for people I made it without and added a little at a time until it was what I knew my family would like. Also only used the juic...
9/1/2008,5,We like food spicy so I replaced the pepper with 1tbs of scotch bonnet pepper sauce.
8/31/2008,5,Sometimes there is nothing better than a fresh guacamole. This was wonderful and got rave reviews from friends. I used extra cilantro because I worship it and a little less salt than called for....
8/30/2008,5,"I normally modify recipes quite a bit but this one was very good as written. Thanks!

However I like things spicy so I added a fresh jalapeno and it kicked up the flavor much more to my liki..."

8/27/2008,5,This is the only guacamole recipe I have made since trying it from this site about three years ago.  It is the best.  A batch only lasts about 10 minutes in my house--my kids and husband love it...
8/27/2008,5,This was very easy to make and it was a great crowd pleaser.  Just make certain you buy ripe avocado.
8/27/2008,5,Excellent dip! I've tried a couple of times to make guacamole that tastes as good as a local mexican restaurant that I frequent. I must say this is even better and my wife agrees. Fresh avocados...
8/27/2008,5,We absolutely loved this!  It was delicious.  My husband added a little bit of chili powder and it really was good.  We even froze half of it in a ziploc baggy and after thawing a few days later...
8/25/2008,5,It was devoured at a party!  Used 2 cloves of garlic and it was perfect (on the garlicky side...which I like).
8/25/2008,5,Sooo good!
8/25/2008,5,Realy good!!
8/24/2008,5,I've been using variations on this recipe all summer.  Feel free to add peppers different tomatoes or whatever you find in your garden.
8/23/2008,5,AWESOME! Only change I made was to add a dash of cumin
8/19/2008,5,Next time I will add a little less of the lime juice but other than that YUM!  I wouldn't change a thing.
8/16/2008,5,if you want good guacamole....look no further. This is a great recipe!!!!
8/14/2008,5,Mmm this guacamole is awesome. I chopped the avocados because I like it chunky. I put onion garlic cilantro and jalepenos in the food processor (my husband doesn't like a strong taste of these...
8/13/2008,5,I was called the Queen of Guacamole after I made this!
8/12/2008,5,I've never had better guacamole than this anywhere.  Thank you sharing this awesome recipe!
8/6/2008,5,I usually just mix an avocado w/salsa but this is a million times more exciting! I love it!I'm addicted
8/5/2008,5,so good!!!  i only wish avocadoes were on sale so i could have doubled the recipe : )
8/4/2008,5,Yum! I used 1 avocado and adjusted all of the other ingredients accordingly. Add garlic powder as well as garlic clove. Tossed in some extra cilantro as well! Oh! And I used lemon instead of lim...
8/4/2008,5,I never liked Guacamole until this recipe.  It's quick and always tastes great.
8/3/2008,5,Great recipe. The only change I made was I used red peppers instead of tomatoes. Also I added much more cilantro and used sea salt. Thanks so much
8/3/2008,5,Great recipe! We omit the garlic and ground cayenne and instead put in a serrano pepper plus a little extra cilantro. Thanks for the recipe!

8/1/2008,5,This guacamole was excellent! I didn't change a thing and it was a big hit with my picky husband.
7/29/2008,5,Great recipe for guac. I am a guac fan anyway but this one beats the store bought stuff hands down.
7/29/2008,5,This was great and the citrus helped keep the guacamole fresh for the day after so it stayed nice and green. Everyone loved it at first I thought it tasted like there was too much lime but afte...
7/28/2008,5,I made this for a wedding shower and people went nuts! none of the other dips got eaten...just this one...SO good..will definitely make again and again!
7/27/2008,5,From New Mexico where we know our guacamole:  AWESOME!  Only change was to add some spicy New Mexican salsa cutting back the tomatoes a bit as the salsa had tomato in it.  Make sure you use a...
7/27/2008,5,Absolutely HANDS DOWN the BEST gucamole recipe EVER. I actually learned this recipe from a few waiter friends I knew that worked at this AMAZING Mexican joint. The key and I seriously mean th...
7/25/2008,5,This recipe is fantastic and I didn't find it bland at all. I used just a little more lime juice than the recipe called for and rather than cayenne pepper I added a splash of hot sauce. I'm not...
7/19/2008,5,Perfect!  Many good Mexican restaurants now do this tableside.  You can get a mortar bowl at Crate and Barrel and mix and serve in same bowl and it looks very impressive.
7/18/2008,5,love it!
7/16/2008,5,This is a wonderful recipe. I have made it several times now for family and friends and everyone absolutley loves it! The lime juice and cilantro really make this stand out. Using fresh cilantro...

7/13/2008,5,By far the best guacamole recipe ever. I've brought it to a few barbecues and people love it.
7/12/2008,5,Fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly opting NOT to add the cayenne pepper. At first I thought it was too much lime but in retrospect the lime kept the dip from turning brown and I think...
7/11/2008,5,The only thing that impoves it is to add the juice from half and orange.
7/9/2008,5,LOVED IT! The only thing I added was 2 tbsp of sour cream. This should be called THE BEST GUACAMOLE!!!
7/9/2008,5,this was excellent!  I will be making this again and again and again.
7/9/2008,5,This is the best guacamole I've ever had!  Even my husband loved it and before this he didn't eat avocados.  Tastes wonderful!
7/8/2008,5,The best!  This was my first attempt at guacamole and it was better than I've had at any restaurant.  I will be making this all summer!
7/8/2008,5,FABULOUS!
7/7/2008,5,So easy and very delicious. I followed the recipe except for not adding the cilantro. My husband usually hates guacamole but loved this.
7/6/2008,5,LOVE THIS RECIPE! I doubled it so it took me more like an hour to make but it was fantastic!
7/4/2008,5,This is a fantastic guac recipe. The cilantro and cayenne pepper give it fresh flavor with a kick. Thanks!
6/30/2008,5,This guacamole was great. I love the cilantro in it except I did use a little less. I have family that think they don't like it but couldn't tell it was in there when I served it. The lime is ...
6/30/2008,5,very good!!!  I have always had a hard time making guacoamole and this is a perfect recipe!!  Instead of tomatoes I just added a can of the hunts diced tomatoes with jalapenos.  Just make sure ...
6/28/2008,5,I loved this recipe! I just made it and it turned out great. My fiance likes his a little spicy so next time might add a little jalapeno.
6/28/2008,5,This is absolutely the best guac recipe I've ever made!  Fresh zippy and keeps well for a few days if you put plastic wrap on the surface of the guacamole to keep it from browning.  Thanks!
6/26/2008,5,I added more salsa to it as another reviewer had suggested. And it turned out great!
6/24/2008,5,perfect! sooo yummy :) i didn't really measure much just eyeballed the ingredients. oh used a 1/2 can of rotell tomatoes w/hot peppers in it instead of tomatoes. with the whole salmonella thin...

6/23/2008,5,This recipe is just perfect...simple fresh ingredients easy to prepare and an absolute show stopper.  Always the first to go at parties.
6/21/2008,5,Excellent guacamole!  The cilantro gives this a very unique flavor.  I like my guacamole chunky so this recipe was perfect!
6/21/2008,5,Very good recipe.  Had to leave out the tomatoes because of the samonilla prob in Cali right now but great even without them.
6/20/2008,5,I followed this recipe as directed and this dip is my new fav!!! Awesome Dip many thanks!!!
6/20/2008,5,I decided to make my own guac for an upcoming party.  I printed many recipes to test before the event.  This was the first and only recipe I tried!  YUMMY!  I made the recipe exactly as is wit...

6/18/2008,5,Absolutely perfect.
6/17/2008,5,Excellent.  I used less onion less garlic and more cayenne pepper.
6/17/2008,5,The proper guacamole people!
6/16/2008,5,This is awesome but if you want a shortcut on all the dicing and chopping just add the lime juice some garlic salt cayenne and some Pace picante sauce (hot) to taste.  Yum!
6/15/2008,5,Very good and very easy to make.  This was a hit at our party!
6/13/2008,5,Good recipe but for all recipes that use avocados try to get the good California Haas avocados. This guacamole was a bit bland with regular avocados (not the recipes fault gave that a 5).
6/9/2008,5,This guacamole is DELICIOUS!!!  My husband made it tonight and we are going to take it to the church picnic later this week.  YUMMY!

6/8/2008,5,Excellent - Would not change a thing!  A definite keeper!
6/6/2008,5,"This is similar to how I make it. I like to add diced sweet peppers and a finely diced jalapeno instead of the cayanne.

6/4/2008,5,This is sooo good as is! I made this for a party and it was gone in 10 minutes! Will just make for my own fridge. Very easy and delicious! Thanks!

5/29/2008,5,This guacamole is so awesome.  It has such a fresh taste.  I always add a bit more hot pepper because I like it spicy.  I always get requests for the recipe.
5/29/2008,5,EXCELLENT!! I used two cloves of garlic and a green chile instead of cayenne. Simply the best Guacamole.
5/29/2008,5,"This was so good I could have eaten it with a spoon!!!
I left out the cayenne pepper (personal preference).  The cilantro makes it special!"

5/23/2008,5,I add 1/2 t cumin and only 1/2 t salt.  This is THE best homemade quacamole!
5/21/2008,5,This was great! I made it for a party of 20 people andeven the kids ate it. I made another dish without the cilantro and jalapeno for the wimps and it was still great! A no-brianer.

9/11/2005,5,This has a wonderful blend of flavors. The cilantro and cayenne are perfect additions! If the lime I use is large sometimes I don't use all of its juice. Every time I make this it's a big hit.
9/5/2005,5,Very good!   I use whatever type of onion I have on hand and usually more of onion and cilantro to suit my taste.  I also substitute fresh jalapeño for the cayenne.
8/11/2005,5,It's the best guacamole I've ever tasted!  The fresh cilantro is the key!
8/7/2005,5,This was better than any guacamole I've ever had at a restaurant.  At first I was disappointed because it had a very limey taste to it but tasted awesome the next day after I let it refrigerate ...
8/6/2005,5,This guacamole is really easy to make and tastes AWESOME!!!
7/23/2005,5,This is excellent - perfect for a party or night-time snack.  I made this exactly as described but added one extra plum tomato.  This will definitely be the first snack to disappear at the party...
7/23/2005,5,Yum! Used a few tablespoons of salsa instead of the tomatoes the second time I made it which turned out to be a great addition but the original recipe is delicious as is.
7/14/2005,5,This is really awesome. I just cut the recipe in half and put the ingredients in my Magic Bullet. It came out great and very fast!
7/7/2005,5,Outstanding!  This is sure to become a favorite at our house!
7/5/2005,5,This was so good thank you Bob. I followed the recipe for the most part except I used only 1 Tablespoon cilantro and I added 1/4 teaspoon cumin. Fabulous!
7/1/2005,5,Excellent!  My husband couldnt stop eating it.  I even liked it and I usually hate guacomole.  This guacomole was the best though!

6/14/2005,5,This was easy to make and tasted great!!
6/4/2005,5,Fantastic!  What more can you say.  When refrigerating it place the avocado pits in the bowl and cover. It'll keep the guac from turning brown.

5/4/2005,5,I made this for a Mother's Day family BBQ and it was a big hit. I only used one tomato and I cut back on the salt. It was so flavorful that we didn't think adding the cayenne was necessary. We...
5/3/2005,5,I haven't even let it marinate yet....and it is already awesome!  I used a purple onion and half of a fresh jalapeno and it didn't even need the cayenne! I will only use this recipe!

3/28/2005,5,Best guacamole I have ever had.  Was told it was even better than any resturant.  You should for sure make a double batch cause it goes fast.

2/13/2005,5,This was super simple and easy to make. Tastes like fresh Guacamole from my favorite restaurant. My friends will never believe I made this!
2/13/2005,5,put more lime juice in it or it has a very short refrigerator life
2/6/2005,5,My Superbowl men were happy with this recipe and I appreciate how easy it was.  Alas the tomato I thought I had was in no condition to add so I threw in some chunky salsa.  Wonderful easy a...
2/6/2005,5,Even though I had to substitute powdered cilantro for the fresh variety the taste was amazing! I can't imagine how much better it would have tasted with the fresh herb.
2/2/2005,5,So easy. So good.  When I'm in a hurry I just throw everything in the food processor.  It turns out very smooth but just as good.  Even some anti-green stuff friends ate some and LOVED it. ...
1/26/2005,5,This recipe is wonderful. The flavor is terrific! Just a tip before you squeeze your fresh lime juice in-try heating the lime up in the microwave for a few seconds. You will get more juice from ...
1/24/2005,5,Excellent guacamole. Easy to prepare and very good flavor. Garnered compliments at our Mexican dinner! Will definitely prepare again.
1/21/2005,5,This was a big hit with everyone.  I substituted Frontera Tomatillo salsa for the tomatoes (1/4 cup) in the recipe and it worked out great.  I plan to use this again very soon.

1/20/2005,5,FABULOUS recipe!  I did make a few changes mostly because I didn't have quite the exact ingredients...Instead of lime I used 1 T. of lemon juice; instead of 1 t. of salt I used only 1/2 t. I...

10/8/2004,5,This was the first time i made guacamole and it was so easy and so delicious!!! I'll never buy store bought again!!! The only thing i will change for the next time is a little less cilantro!!
10/6/2004,5,The Best!! Only you MUST make sure to use ripe (not hard) HAAS avocados--they have the most flavor! I use 4 avocados no garlic (sometimes no onion) and 2-4 small jalapeno or serrano peppers in...

7/31/2004,5,Just like my favorite restaurant where I often make a meal out of the guac.  Also leave the pits in the container to prevent browning.
7/26/2004,5,It's wonderful! Tastes like restaurant guacamole. Definetely add the cayenne pepperit finishes it off!
7/21/2004,5,Excellent recipe!  Tastes just like the guacamole in an authentic Mexican restaurant when one uses the juice of a lemon instead of that of a lime.  I love guacamole so much that I made it twice ...

5/2/2004,5,My first try at homemade guacamole was a success thanks to this great recipe.  It did take me a little longer than 10 minutes to prepare.  My family loved it.
4/29/2004,5,Fantastic and easy. I've made it twice this week already!  I couldn't get quite the right spice with cayenne pepper so instead I added a couple shakes of Tabasco.  That did the trick.  Very goo...

2/27/2003,5,This is an excellent guacamole recipe.  The only thing is that I included the juice of one lime but it was too much.  Maybe I should have used a Mexican lime because those are smaller.  Anyway...

7/18/2015,5,So DELICIOUS!!!  I had the extra time and placed it in a crock pot on low for 6 hours amazing marriage of flavors.
5/5/2014,5,Fantastic! For the people who said this was inedible you are either not used to cooking with Cumin and/or Nutmeg. However if you have cooked recipes using these spices be careful as to how much...
3/21/2013,5,This is a fantastic recipe. It's a hit everytime I make this dish. No matter the occasion and its so easy!! Now I use the spice mix on all kinds of meat and they all turn out fantastically! Fi...
1/21/2012,5,My husband isn't a big fan of chicken but I knew with my first bite he would love this. My young girls also enjoyed it. The rice is a nice change and the chicken is extremely flavorful. My hus...
9/16/2011,5,excellent!
9/11/2011,5,Made this dish the other night for dinner and it was wonderful. The pineapple cilantro rice went well with the spicy carribean chicken. Served the chicken over the rice with a nice glass of mosc...

8/30/2011,5,My family loved this. This is dish is quite light and the addition of the cilantro and pineapple to the rice makes it quite refreshing especially on a hot summer night like tonight. Will defin...
8/27/2011,5,Very good!I grilled the chicken and I did reduce the spices (except for the brown sugar) by half and had just the right amount for three large chicken breasts. I also used the pineapple juice fo...
9/28/2017,4,easy and delicious.  Will definitely be making again.
9/18/2017,4,This dish was ok but a bit to spicy for most of my family. The first day it was ok the second day we could barely eat the chicken it was extremely hot to taste. If you love hot/spicy food then w...
9/13/2017,4,Solid dish! I didn't have any chili powder so I used a little bit of white pepper a pinch of cayenne and some extra garlic powder . The chicken was delicious and super juicy (though I think I ...
6/21/2017,4,This dish was a bit spicy for my 6 yr old ds.  I will make it again but will cut the hot spices to 1/2 a tap.  The only change I made was to put some pineapple juice in with the rice as it co...
9/22/2015,4,I made this last nite and it was yummy. This gives me another way to bake chicken thanks for this recipe!
4/4/2013,4,I made it pretty much as written. There was a little too much black pepper for my kids so if I make it again I'll  half the black pepper. Otherwise everyone like it. The rice was a big hit.
9/1/2011,4,I also used I bit more brown sugar as it seemed to be a bit strong in taste and I also cooked my rice in a rice steamer and used half pineapple juice and half water and it came out a bit too sti...
8/26/2011,4,this was pretty good although I used brown rice which i don't recommend.  Pretty quick and definitly fool-proof.  i look forward to trying it again but with white rice...ill get my whole grain ...
8/24/2011,4,Loved this dish. I was a little skeptical about the rice but it turned out lovely. The only thing that I would do different next time would be to back off on the amount of rub I put on the chick...

10/8/2013,3,It was good.  Add pineapple juice for part of the water for extra flavoring.
3/5/2013,3,Good but not great. The rice was a bit bland and chicken was quite spicey. the pineapple to me didn't blend well with the dish. it seemed it was just there. it didn't enhance any flavors to me. ...
12/14/2013,2,*I AM ONLY RATING THE RICE* Used the rice recipe to accompany some carribean marinated shrimp on the grill.  Had high hopes for the rice but it was just ok.  Nothing to write home about.  Will k...

9/24/2012,5,Really a wonderful basic!  It is also a great dish to build on as long as you saute the heck out of that onion and curry paste (I prefer curry paste) you cam throw just about any protein in it.
9/24/2012,5,This is so full of flavor! I use 2 TB of yellow curry and 1 TB of red curry.  I also add a head of fresh cauliflower or a bag of frozen.  I also usually add some arrow root to thicken towards t...

8/12/2012,5,Wow. Absolutely delicious! As others suggested I mixed the oil and curry for 5 minutes then added in and mixed the onions for about 10 minutes.  Once the chicken was done I added in freshly sl...
8/9/2012,5,This was just a touch sweeter than I anticipated so I might dial that back a bit next time. Or I might use brown sugar -- there's another curried chicken with coconut recipe on here that uses br...

6/16/2012,5,I loved this recipe but living at a high altitude does require more fluid to start with. Also i used less tomato sauce more coconut milk and fresh tomato instead of canned.

5/23/2012,5,Great recipe! But I only added 1 1/2 tablespoon of sugar and it was perfect. 3 tablespoons would have been way to sweet for our tastes.
5/19/2012,5,I didn't think I even like curry but I wanted to try something different.  I loved this dish so much that after we ate every bite of chicken for dinner I went to the freezer to get another pou...

1/24/2012,5,This was lovely.  You definitely need to simmer it a long time to get a concentrated flavor.  I added large chunks of butternut squash which really added another layer of depth.

1/17/2012,5,I am giving it 5 stars based off the changes I made per some of the reviews I read.  The few changes I made were to add 3.5TBS curry powder (I probably could have gotten away with 4TBS).  I also...

1/3/2012,5,Yum!  This was a big hit with my kids.  I added a bit of crushed red pepper since it really seemed like a dish that could use some heat - only about 1/2 teaspoon gives it a nice kick but I'm a w...
1/3/2012,5,Kids: 9 and 11 loved this!  Personally I'd prefer more curry taste.  Will add 3Tbsp curry paste next time.  I used unsweetened coconut milk the 3tbsp sugar called for and it was perfect for us.
1/1/2012,5,This was sooo good and so easy to make.  I didn't have an 8oz can of tomato sauce or diced stewed tomatoes so instead I used two 14.5oz of plum tomatoes which I pureed with a hand blender becau...

11/7/2011,5,Great recipe! Did it over the weekend only thing that I didn't use was the garlic. Thanks Roma for sharing this!
11/7/2011,5,This recipe was sooooo good!  Those who said the sauce was too runny are CRAZY!!!!  They probably just didn't use two pounds of chicken like the recipe said. And if they use tomato paste instead...
11/5/2011,5,"soooooooooooooooo goodddddddddddd! Thanks so much. 
The only thing I changed is that I put more curry one more table spoon.
My husband told me to put some hot pepers next time."
11/4/2011,5,DH and I made this together the other night and it was delicious!  We severed it over rice with asparagus on the side and it made a lovely meal.  The leftovers re-heated were delicious too.  We ...

10/27/2011,5,Tasty! Makes me feel like a competent Indian cook!
10/24/2011,5,This was great. Next time I would try to reduce the liquid some probably draining the tomatoes.
10/24/2011,5,Fantastic and quick. I like to drain the can of tomatoes before I add it to the mix to ensure the right viscosity.
10/24/2011,5,This was absolutely delicious! I used 1/2 a large shallot instead of an onion (didn't have one) and I used a little more oil in the beginning cause the curry oil became too thick. All in all it ...
10/20/2011,5,Made this today it's a very good recipe.  Used madras curry powder 4 cloves garlic instead of 2 crushed in a garlic crusher. Used a whole medium sized onion and 1.5 tblsp of Splenda instead of...

8/23/2011,5,i cook this once a month...  but (as suggested) use curry paste oil and onion to make the base... and add extra curry powder and even cayenne to spice this one up..   GREAT RECIPE
8/23/2011,5,I really enjoy it. My family is not a curry fan though so I ate it alone and at the end of it I had had enough for a while.
8/23/2011,5,Great recipe cheat to make.  40 minutes is enough time to simmer.  Make sure you do a strong simmer not a rice simmer.  Mild bubbling at Medium low for 40 minutes does the trick.  Your house wi...
8/22/2011,5,I also cut back on the sugar.  I thickened with cornstarch.   I skimped on the chicken since I didn't have enough.... definitely need 2#.
8/19/2011,5,This was really delicious. Maybe next time leave out the tomato sauce. Hubby did not like. Left house smelling like Indian curry for days.

8/8/2011,5,Yum! Truly unique taste...curry with sweet tropics...My husband even liked it and he hates tomatoes!

7/29/2011,5,This is a really great recipe.  It's simple and always turns out tasty.  I follow the directions of another reviewer and make the broth as she suggested.
7/27/2011,5,Roma I could kiss you square in the mouth! This was my first time following a recipe (followed to a T) and I am so happy with the results. Recently I had been told that my cooking was bland an...

7/10/2011,5,Awesome!  Best recipe from this website yet.  Thank you!!

1/9/2011,5,I made a few changes I didnt add the can of tomato sauce since I already had diced tomatoes and added some of the jarred curry paste with a little bit of water. To top it off it sounds crazy ...
1/8/2011,5,the best thanks
1/7/2011,5,This is a very easy and good recipe. I didn't change a thing. I think it's important to just quickly sear the chicken in the pan because it can verge on overcooking it with the additonal 30 minu...
1/7/2011,5,Have been making this dish for quite a while now about twice a month and thought I would share my preferences.  I use Goya brand coconut milk; it just tastes better than other brands I have used...

1/2/2011,5,Excellent!  Used light coconut milk and added some extra curry.  Simmered for an hour and it was still thin but the brown rice i had it over soaked it up.

12/2/2010,5,We love this recipe!  We made it vegetarian by using Morningstar Farms Meal Starter Chik'n Strips or Mun Cha'i Yah(mock duck) and doubling the sauce.  I used Shan curry mix and omitted salt a...
12/2/2010,5,I have a diabetic boyfriend who is a finicky eater loathing both tomatos and 'mushy textured food' as he calls it. With all of that to contend with I can say that this dish was a HUGE success! ...
11/29/2010,5,Good different dish for us southerners.
11/29/2010,5,Very simple and taste great...I believe flavor all depends on the curry powder you use...So make sure to get fresh high quality curry powder or make your own.

10/25/2010,5,I only used 2 chicken breasts but kept the seasonings the same because I wanted a substancial sauce to go with it. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. At the very end I felt it needed a b...

10/8/2010,5,This was my first attempt at making curry and I loved it. I used fresh tomatoes and did not have any tomato sauce so I used a little bit of condensed tomato soup and it still turned out great.

9/29/2010,5,The most amazing dish I've had in a while. I used chicken thighs and cut the curry powder down to 1.5 tablespoons because I'm a bit of a wuss when it comes to heat.
9/26/2010,5,This is delicious! I use a 20 oz can of whole tomatoes instead of stewed and don't add tomato sauce. It's really good with pork. Follow the advice about cooking the curry powder in the oil for ...

9/21/2010,5,I thought the recipe was excellent. I read other reviews first and didn't use all of the liquid (drained tomatoes and only used a little over half of the tomator sauce) and it was great. I added...
9/19/2010,5,If I could I would give this one 4 and 1/2 stars the missing half would be for the tomatoes.  I did not care to have chunks of tomato in it I think it would be must better to just leave them o...

9/13/2010,5,Really delicious!  Used brown sugar in place of white and light coconut milk.  Simmered uncovered for about 45 minutes so it thickened up nicely.  Lots of requests for the recipe!
9/9/2010,5,I love chicken curry and I have 3 recipes that I inter-change. This however is now my favorite. My husband made it last night and it was GREAT -full of flavor just spicy enough and healthy...

8/14/2010,5,This was a great recipe.  I use the light coconut milk available at Trader Joe's to help cut down the fat and calories.  Others have mentioned letting the curry cook in the oil initially with ...

7/13/2010,5,Fantastic. I like the rec. to cut the tomatos up but really you need two cans (drain 1 can of liquid) of it for 2 lbs. meat.  Also it would have been helpful to reserve at least 1/4 cup of liqui...

2/24/2010,5,This is a great recipe!.  I used less chicken (it's only my husband and me) and the same amount of liquids so I simmered it uncovered so that the sauce would thicken more.  If I made it with 2 ...

2/23/2010,5,This was absolutely delicious! One of the best recipes I have made in a while. I made half the recipe with chicken and half with firm tofu. I separated the curry/oil/onion/garlic mixture into tw...

2/22/2010,5,could use a bit more spice

1/30/2010,5,This turned out great! Although I would change the sugar requirement to to taste as 3 tablespoons was too sweet for us. Also I think it could've handled a whole onion instead of a half...less ...

1/25/2010,5,My husband and I really liked this dish!  I followed the recipe except I only had half a can of coconut milk so I opened a can of coconut cream and used half of that as well.  I did drain the ca...
1/24/2010,5,Take the chicken out when it is just cooked or it will get dry and hard. I served this over jasmine rice and it was great. My 2 4 and 7 year olds ate it up. I will add a bit of red curry powde...

12/12/2009,5,My adult sons loved this and gave it a 5 star.  I give it a 4 star.  I thought it was a tad bit to sweet.  Next time I'll only use 1.5 T of sugar. Other then that it was great.
12/10/2009,5,This was delicious. I've made it four times now. Every time it's a hit. My Husband says it's his second favorite food. The first is steak. Yeah it's that good!
12/9/2009,5,This was my first curry and it was delicious despite my error in adding twice as much tomato sauce. I added more curry powder to compensate. I followed others advice to keep the windows open to ...

9/13/2009,5,I liked this a lot.  The only thing I changed is that I also added shrimp.  It reminded me of Thai masaman curry.  I'm contemplating adding potatoes next time.

10/25/2007,5,Tasty curry recipe.  It was sweet yet a little spicy.
10/21/2007,5,A very nice basic recipe.  I added tofu and peas to mine (I just really like tofu and peas).  Definitely cook the curry in the oil as the recipe states.  It helps bring out the curry flavor more.
10/15/2007,5,Just a side note: make sure to open your kitchen windows and turn the stove fan on otherwise your house will smell like curry for a week or more.  Mine still has the faint scent of curry and i...

10/23/2008,5,This is awesome! I make this dip everytime I have a party the only problem I seem to have is trying not to eat it all before the guests arrive! I like to serve it with tortilla chips.

10/21/2008,5,I halved this recipe because I didn't have enough chicken.  I loved it with celery but my 8 and 6 yr old devoured it with crackers.  Hubby was a little disappointed that he didn't get very much...
10/21/2008,5,This was great!  Next time I'm going to try substituting the ranch with bleu cheese and maybe some blue cheese crumbles on top.

10/5/2008,5,Excellent dish for a party starter.  I prefer to add all of the cheddar to the mix instead of topping the dish with cheddar.  The cooked cheddar is a little hard to get a cracker into.
10/5/2008,5,I love this but we make it a little different. We put the cream cheese on the bottom of a dish then put the chicken/blue cheese/hot sauce on top of the cream cheese and cover with cheese. Bake i...

8/3/2008,5,I've made this dip for a couple of parties and it's been a hit! I prefer to use celery sticks or plain crackers for dipping; the chicken-flavored crackers are a bit much with this dip.

12/29/2004,5,This recipe is the perfect non-traditional appetizer.  Works well as a dip for crackers and veggies but also works well as a spread for bagels.

12/19/2004,5,Fantastic - a new family favorite!  Instead of heating the chicken and pepper sauce first I just threw everything into the slow cooker and stirred ocassionally until well-blended.
12/17/2004,5,FABULOUS!  I won't be able to make this too often -- I can't stay out it even cold!  I don't think it needs quite as much shredded cheese. I've already forwarded this to several friends.
12/16/2004,5,This was great. I made it for Christmas day and will definately be making it again.

12/4/2004,5,Very easy to make and tastes so good! I used fat-free cream cheese and fat-free ranch dressing and it was still really good. This is also very good refrigerated with cheese flavored crackers.
12/3/2004,5,Being from BfloNy this is the closest to ck wings. If you substitute 2 boiled ck brst & shred them instead of canned ckn & use a bottle of blue cheese instead of ranch it works even much much...

2/1/2004,5,Made this for superbowl sunday.  A big hit.  We used Archie Moore's buffalo wing sauce (our absolute fav) and fat free cream cheese.  It was wonderful.  It will be a required addition to our app...
1/28/2004,5,This is fantastic! We used light cream cheese lite ranch dressing too. Used Cookie's brand wing sauce (our fave) instead of Frank's. Warmed it all on the stove top and bypassed the crock pot. ...
1/24/2004,5,This is sooo good!!!  I cut the recipe in half and baked it in the oven for 20 min instead of the slow-cooker. Next time I'll try it with blue cheese dressing instead od ranch. Either way you c...
1/23/2004,5,I have made this before and it is awesome. Instead of the ranch dressing I used blue cheese and didn't use cheddar cheese. It is so addicting!
11/15/2017,5,Perfect!!! Don’t change a thing!
11/10/2017,5,I made this for a potluck followed the recipe exactly except for an extra clove of garlic. I made my own tahini. It was a real hit!

10/1/2017,5,i'll never buy hummus from the store again.  I added one hot pepper for a little kick.
8/10/2017,5,Did the second option with cumin and three spoons of Tahini. Delicious!!! (I used a blender. The texture was great)
7/30/2017,5,Awesome! Always devoured at parties. I've made it loads :-)
7/17/2017,5,I have tried several hummus recipes and this was by far the easiest and tastiest.

4/15/2017,5,Perfect!  Followed the updated recommendations for cumin and extra tahini.  So yummy!!!
4/12/2017,5,1 raw garlic is fine try using roasted garlic.  Drain almost all liquid from beans.  Try cumin or curry or garam masala.
4/6/2017,5,I love hummus and this recipe tastes very yummy!
3/14/2017,5,Great recipe. Very easy. I don't use Tahini though and it comes out just as good!

2/18/2017,5,Even without the tahini this was easy and delicious.
1/21/2017,5,Ding! Ding! Ding! Winner! Thanks RoyHobbs. I've been making this for several years now since it was one of the very few healthy vegetarian tings my late husband would eat cheerfully. The only...
1/13/2017,5,Great. thank you - you're cumin tip made it perfect. I would emphasize blending it enough and not being tempted to stop early.

1/2/2017,5,Super good..Fantastic Recipe loved it Thankyou
12/30/2016,5,This is the first time we have made hummus. I like the fact that it is so cheap to make. To think we were spending about five dollars a week on the store bought stuff. I wonder what else we can ...
12/26/2016,5,It was fine!   I added the sun-dried tomato and an extra pinch of cayenne because we like the heat.  A very tasty simple recipe!
12/19/2016,5,I ALWAYS make this recipe!!!!  It's the best ever!!!  The only thing I added was finely ground red pepper on top!
11/30/2016,5,"Made as is. Very good wouldn't change a thing. 
I do prefer using organic beans the taste is much better."
11/27/2016,5,Good solid basic hummus recipe. I went heavier on the garlic and added a bit of cumin. I like this recipe. Thanks for sharing it.
11/27/2016,5,This was really good.  I made it as adapted by the cook -- adding cumin and 4 tablespoons tahini (which I made from a recipe also on this site) and it is delicious!  Next time I will add just ...
11/8/2016,5,Aside from using almond butter rather than tahini I make this per the recipe and I love it I have made it several times and have always been happy with the result.
11/8/2016,5,I followed the recipe with the changes from the chef found in the reviews. It is so easy and very good. I was shy on the cumin at the beginning so I added some until I liked the strength. Also ...
11/4/2016,5,"AMAZING recipie! As I didn't have Tahimi I made it myself with sesame seeds and a little bit of olive oil in the minipimer. And then made the Hummus. 
I only used 1/3 of the juice from the can ..."

10/18/2016,5,delicious better if made ahead.
10/16/2016,5,This one is definitely for keeps. Absolutely lovely recipe though I did increase the lemon juice proportion. Will definitely repeat.
10/3/2016,5,Came out great. Cut back on the salt garlic and lemon juice .. feel the garlic and lemon juice over power the taste of the chic peas ...used chic peas not beans :)
9/10/2016,5,Great base!  Made one batch plain and upped the garlic added one chipotle pepper and a bit of adobo sauce to the second batch and the third added a little adobo sauce a hot pepper with lime s...
9/8/2016,5,I can't really improve on this by much.  I had whole cumin which I roasted in the oven on a lightly oiled sheet (or one can use a skillet-as soon as you smell it it's done and about to burn so ...
6/17/2016,5,this recipe is simple easy to make and so much better than store bought. I often double it or use as a base and add other goodies like roasted peppers garlic and artichokes.
6/17/2016,5,Delicious easy and healthy! I made it once with a teaspoon of salt and once with a half- teaspoon of salt and I prefer it with the half- teaspoon. It gets a little thicker after it's been refr...
6/15/2016,5,Perfect base! I topped mine with sun dried tomatoes chopped super fine and their herbed oil. Delicious! (And WAY cheaper to make it at home that buy it!)
6/8/2016,5,Delicious and even better  the next day.  Ooops I added one Tbsp of olive oil to mix in blender.  It was fine.
6/3/2016,5,This is essentially the same recipe that I use with the exception that I add 1/2 teaspoon if cumin and a 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper. Also it is easier to make in a food processor than a blen...
6/3/2016,5,I followed the updates by the author of this recipes. WOW! I will never buy commercial brands again. The best tahini is Trader Joe's. It is in a flat round container similar to sour cream. Not e...
5/8/2016,5,Made it like the recipe directed but I added more lemon juice and an extra tablespoon of tahini.  Also a bit of paprika which I love.  Good recipe.
4/18/2016,5,We make this all the time! So easy and yummy.  The trick really is keeping the liquid from the chick pea can to add for creaminess.  We like it smooth!
4/10/2016,5,So good.  The Tahini paste is really good. This is a great recipe to adjust to your liking  more or less lemon more or less garlic more or less salt.  I live on the south side of Chicago and ...
2/28/2016,5,The Tahini makes this so much more interestin.  I used 2 garlic not 1 which seems about right.  I used full 1/3 cup olive oil just to make it smoother and not so granular from dryness and cut th...
2/27/2016,5,I love this recipe but had to adjust it for flavor.  I use the cumin instead of pepper and I use only 1 tablespoon of tahini..  I use less salt and toast my pita bread when I serve it!
1/24/2016,5,I loved this! I don't always like store bought hummus and this recipe was really good. Made the adjustments the author of the recipe suggested. After chilling it was perfect. The garlic flavou...

I reserved all of the liquid and then slowly added it back to the thickness I prefer and added a little jalapeño to spice it up.

Better than any store..."
1/9/2016,5,The only change I made was to add another clove of garlic nor did I use any reserve liquid from the can of beans.  I slowly drizzled the olive oil while the food processor was blending until I...
12/31/2015,5,Delicious who knew I could make hummus so fast and easy! Everyone in my house loved it! I will definitely be making it again.
12/28/2015,5,Until I made Hummus from this recipe I never cared for it. My friends Barbara and Lou absolutely love it when I bring Hummus to work.
12/23/2015,5,I left out the salt and added a bit more garlic. I also added a small amount of cumin. Reserve liquid from the beans and add it until you get your desired consistency.
11/1/2015,5,I used cumin and roasted some red peppers and also added cayenne for spice. My friends and family loved it.
10/21/2015,5,This is my go to recipe it's great as is or is also a good base recipe as well. Sometimes I will add roasted red pepper or sesame seeds etc....

4/10/2015,5,Excellent recipe. Only change I made was to stir in the olive oil at the end and to lightly dust with ground paprika instead of the black pepper - looks very pretty.  Next time I will crush the ...
3/10/2015,5,I had hummus for the first time at the home on an Indian family who'd recently come to the US.  I loved it.  This is the closest recipe I've found.  They used home made tahini but the lady told ...

1/19/2015,5,We loved it!  Per other suggestions I added 1/2 tsp salt otherwise I followed directly taking tips from the authors comments too.  I like mine on the thinner side so I used more of the liquid....
1/19/2015,5,I really REALLY love this recipe! Every time I make hummus I always come back to use this recipe. Besides the author's alterations the only thing I change about the recipe is I always add doubl...

6/25/2014,5,YUM! I've tried a few different recipes for humus and this one is a winner.  I'm a garlic lover so I added a little bit more and I blended the olive oil into the humus. I also read some of the r...

10/11/2012,5,This was wonderful! It was a tad salty but I liked it. Next time I can always use fresh cooked chick peas instead if I don't want it as salty. But it was perfect for dipping veggies! This will b...
10/8/2012,5,I have been searching for an authentic hummus and this is it.  I doubled it and it was delicious and quick.
10/1/2012,5,Much better than other similar recipes for hummus that I've tried in the past!  Don't think I'll be buying it from the store anymore since this one is so easy.
9/15/2012,5,This is a really delicious hummus. I added some morrocan spices and olive oil on top at the end and had it with pita bread. Yum!!!
9/14/2012,5,Good. I add cumin and just for personal taste use significantly less lemon juice.
9/14/2012,5,Fresh hummus is so much better tasting than the grocery store stuff! I did a couple of test batches and think the recipe is pretty solid.  Make sure to use fresh squeezed lemon juice though.  A...

8/25/2012,5,Excellent! Perfect blend of flavors.  I reduced the salt to half a tsp. and increased the garlic to 2 cloves.  I would reduce the fluid as I prefer a thicker hummus next time.
8/20/2012,5,"Wow!  
This was awesome!  Put it in a little plastic container and just let DH assume it came from the little Lebanese deli down the street.  They make incredible hummus but it's expensive esp..."
8/20/2012,5,This is so good and so easy to make.  Sometimes I add a few jalapeno slices.  I wouldn't think of buying hummus.
8/19/2012,5,I used no black pepper more garlic (love garlic!) and less salt.  Best recipe I've found.  Great as a base to make your own flavors.
8/18/2012,5,delicious and easy recipe.
8/12/2012,5,Great recipe. I've tried other recipes for hummus and always ended up throwing most of it away not with this one. Really simple and good. I used the 3 tbsp on tahini like the author recommended...

ABOUT THE SALT:

8/4/2012,5,Great recipe I just tip the whole contents of the chick peas in the blender it contains just the right amount of liquid touch more lemon juice and a touch of white pepper perfect for us!
7/27/2012,5,Very good easy hummus! I made mine in the Baby Bullet and reduced the amount of lemon to 3 tbsp. to cut back on the lemon flavor just a little bit.
7/8/2012,5,Thanks for a delicious and easy recipe!
7/3/2012,5,I had never tried hummus before but I was tired of the same old same old. So I bought the stuff and made some hummus. Used fresh beans. Mine turned out fairly chunky as I don't have a food pro...

5/9/2012,5,I love hummus! It's one of those things that I would eat over and over again and definitely would be in my last dinner menu. I've tried many from different places and some better than others ...
4/18/2012,5,This is a great recipe!  I add a good 5-10 shakes of cumin and then more to taste when eating.  I also use all the garbanzo beans.  Skip the black pepper and olive oil.
4/15/2012,5,Excellent! Best hummus I've made. Followed suggestions to add cumin and use 2 cloves of garlic. Just eyeballed the amounts on everything. Didn't have any tahini on hand and it was still great!
4/14/2012,5,
4/12/2012,5,This is seriously yummy.  I followed the writers suggestions and added some hot sauce for some kick.  I didn't have enough lemon juice so added some lime juice it turned out sooo good!
4/8/2012,5,turned out great used navy beans instead
4/6/2012,5,I followed the writers updated suggestions and it turned out perfectly worth keeping this recipe around for a quick dip.
4/5/2012,5,I just made this. I used the OP's revised recipe (more tahini more garlic less salt) and it is divine. Next time I'll probably just amp up the garlic and keep the tahini the original measureme...
4/2/2012,5,Great recipie!  Followed it pretty much to a T but used dried beans.  I ended up using about 1/2 pound dried beans and 3/4 cup of water.  Salt to taste since they were dried not canned.  Add so...

3/18/2012,5,Great recipe.  I added 1/2 cup of plain yogurt to make it smoother which is how I prefer hummus.

3/13/2012,5,Good but need to decrease salt to personal taste this is too salty.  Very easy to make and fast to prepare.  Next time I plan to use only olive oil didn't like the tahini oil. I added cayenne ...
3/10/2012,5,So good! It tastes just like the Hummus a local Lebanese restaurant serves.and so much cheaper to make!   A can of garbanzo beans goes a long way!
3/7/2012,5,A great recipe!  I omit the tahini and add some extra galic and lemon instead.  Gets raves every time!
3/3/2012,5,Easy and quick and so much better than store bought.
3/2/2012,5,Easy to make just delicious!! Thank you :).
3/1/2012,5,Sounds good but to really make it 'from scratch' make your own tahini!  Bob's Red Mill brand of White Sesame Seeds has recipes for both the tahini (made from the sesame seeds) and hummus on the ...
2/28/2012,5,Good stuff!  I added some of the garbanzo juice to smooth it out and YYYYYUUUUUUMMMMMMMMY!

2/5/2012,5,So delicious!!
1/29/2012,5,Wonderful recipe!  I add cumin and a dash of cayenne pepper.  If you don't have tahini you can also just add 3 tbsps of sesame seeds and puree.  (tahinin is sesame seed butter).

2/14/2010,5,I have been trying for weeks to master a simple basic hummus with good consistency and I found it here!  Very tasty!
2/9/2010,5,I have been using this recipe since I discovered it a year and half ago. It is perfect- though I do change it to taste. I use more Garlic- 3 or 4 cloves - and use the authors recomendation of cu...
2/5/2010,5,I made this with the changes the author suggested and it tasted WONDERFUL!
1/18/2010,5,Great starter recipe! I used the cumin like the author suggested and made mine quite creamy.  Very tasty.
1/9/2010,5,Delicious. Used dried garbanzo beans instead of canned so had to add water to achieve the desired mushyness as well as soak and boil the beans beforehand. This is a classic recipe. Made the ta...
1/8/2010,5,Okay WOW! I just made this with all the edited suggestions by the original author (= 2 cloves of garlic instead of one 3 tbsp tahini instead of 2 and cumin instead of black pepper) and I'm b...
1/3/2010,5,Best hummus I've ever made! My in-laws who don't eat many exotic foods came to our vegan home and absolutely fell in love with this. I had to quadruple the recipe!
12/27/2009,5,Using the original subitters changes (2 cloves garlic 3 Tbs Tahini 1/2 tsp salt and cumin instead of pepper) this was the BEST hummus I'd ever had!  Try it... you'll never look for another rec...
11/27/2009,5,I make hummus at least once a weak and I used to discard the liquid in the can  but after trying this I have to admit that the liquid makes difference  it gives the hummus a stronger flavor . ...
11/4/2009,5,This recipe was awesome! It went perfectly with wheat pitas and couscous.
10/29/2009,5,SO GOOOD!!! THANKS FOR SHARING
10/11/2009,5,This is great.  Of course roasted red bell peppers can be added for a spicy flavor.  I boiled the beans for 20 minutes first and added filtered water while blending for consistency.  Adding fr...
9/27/2009,5,I have a lemon tree and have made this recipe a few times already when I'm in the mood for fresh hummus! An excellent base to experiment with.  I add the cumin and salt to taste.  Sometimes I bl...
9/17/2009,5,We love this recipe its a good place to start when learning how to make hummus because any add-in you want can come from this as a start and it would work. I agree with others though I do not...
9/15/2009,5,Made it with the author's updates to the recipe. It was delicious.
9/13/2009,5,Made as is and was good as is. I would play with it next time...just because that's half the fun :0
9/3/2009,5,This is the best hummus recipe I have tried so far.  Since we love garlic I put more garlic (double the amount) than the recipe called for.  Just perfect.  I was also too lazy to squeeze real l...
8/31/2009,5,Great hummus recipe. I didn't make any changes and I liked the resulting taste and texture (I used the submitter's suggested changes) and I would make this again and again. Served with Peppy'...
8/25/2009,5,Awesome!  Followed the tips by submitter RoyHobbs (great name) in his review and it came out perfect.  My young kids who did not like my last attempt at homemade hummus love this recipe.  It ...
8/6/2009,5,So easy and remarkably similar to professional grade hummus! I had no idea I could make the store bought stuff so well and cheaply. I was worried my lack of a food processor would complicate the...
8/6/2009,5,WOW...great recipe. Thanks for sharing. I read your suggestions and used the 2 cloves of garlic and cumin (instead of black pepper). I used the juice of half a lemon and a little lime juice. I ...
8/2/2009,5,This was exactly the flavor I was looking for! I added one extra clove of garlic since we love garlic. I soaked about a cup of dry garbanzos overnight and cooked them 'fresh' for the recipe. Exc...
7/29/2009,5,This is the best hummus recipe I have ever found.  It's perfect and delicious!  Even my husband who is leery of any foreign food scarfs it down.
7/18/2009,5,The best basic hummus recipe that I have found... Very Good. I have made it many times now.
7/6/2009,5,I made this as per the updated instructions.  Fabulous!  The only things I changed were a little less lemon juice and I also added a shake of a mediterranean seasoning blend that I have.  I've n...
7/4/2009,5,Excellent basic recipe.  I look forward to making variations of it.
6/11/2009,5,Awesome and so easy!  I hated to spend so much on tahini but it was well worth it and pays for itself once you've made this a couple of times. I used 2 tsp crushed garlic 3.5 Tbl lemon juice ...
6/9/2009,5,Really tasty. If ou are going to add more garlic i would advise you to roast it. Raw garlic can be hot and overpowering (and this is coming from a true garlic lover). I put two cloves of raw ...
6/3/2009,5,Used two cloves of garlic and no olive oil. Also had to make my own tahini as where I am located (Moscow Russia) couldn't find it anywhere - that was a pain. The end result was superb. Exactly...
6/1/2009,5,I've finally found a hummus recipe I LOVE.  I only used 3 tbsp of lemon juice half the salt 5 tbsp of the chickpea liquid and I also added 1/2 tsp dill (because I love dilly hummus).  I blend...
5/16/2009,5,Wonderful.  I wouldn't change a thing.
5/10/2009,5,great as it is or as a base recipe to venture from.
4/26/2009,5,This is the most authentic hummus recipe I've found. There's no need for heavy spices- just simple flavors.
4/7/2009,5,This hummus was wonderful.  I didn't change anything.  My husband and I enjoyed it as a dip for veggies and pita chips.
4/4/2009,5,Just like the hummus my Israeli-Canadian friend's dad made for her brother's bar mitzvah!  I really recommend making it the night before you want to use it to let the flavours blend better.  I d...
3/29/2009,5,Perfect and extremely simple. I stuck a huge whisk in my jar of tahina to get it going that was the most difficult. Threw everything in the processor turned it on salt and pepper to taste su...
3/2/2009,5,Very tasty and easy recipe.
2/24/2009,5,So very yummy!  I wanted to use this in wraps and sandwiches so I wanted it pretty thick and ended up using less than 1/4 cup of the reserved liquid. Thanks to the updates of the author I adde...
2/5/2009,5,Definately a hit at my house! I added a pinch of cumin and added the olive oil while I was blending. I used 2 cloves of garlic and thought it was a little too much for my tastes but the kids gob...
2/2/2009,5,This was very good I used 3 cloves of garlic because that's how my family eats.  Next time I would not use so much of the bean liquid it was a little runny for our taste.  But very good I'll ...
1/25/2009,5,Mmmmm... this is sooo good! I like my hummus really garlicky so I doubled the garlic and it is uh-MA-zing!
1/23/2009,5,This hummus tastes just like the Mediterranean restaurant's down the street. I make this for some family gatherings as an appetizer and have never had a complaint.
1/18/2009,5,This was excellent. This is what hummus from my local middle eastern restaurant tastes like. After I made this by the recipe I tasted it and then I added some roasted red pepper to it.  It tas...
1/11/2009,5,I love this recipe. My fiance begs me to make this all the time. The only thing I add is a little bit of chopped fresh dill. All around this recipe is a keeper!
1/10/2009,5,Very very good.  I suggest that you adjust the garlic and lemon to how you will serve this.  When I use this as a sandwich spread with raw veggies I max out the garlic and lemon but when I am g...
1/9/2009,5,This is a very good and easy hummus recipe.  The only thing I changed was reducing the lemon juice to 1/2 teaspoon because I don't like a strong lemon flavor.  The addition of cumin instead of b...
1/5/2009,5,Wow!  I'll never buy it in the jar again.  I followed the recipe according to the updated version of the original poster.  I love the flavor of the cumin.  I don't drizzle the olive oil either a...
1/3/2009,5,This recipe was really easy to make and the seasonings were just right.  I left all the liquid from the can of chick peas so it ended up really thin but I like it this way.   I like the fact tha...
12/19/2008,5,I followed the author's updated version and found it to be easy and tasty. The cumin adds great flavor.  I use only 1 clove of garlic especially if it will sit for a day or so because the garli...

11/19/2008,5,This was delicious! I could not stop eating it! Perfect with pita chips. We made according to recipe and then added some sun dried tomatos we had on hand. Drizzled top with olive oil and sprinkl...
11/18/2008,5,My pediatrician told me it would be fine to feed my almost one year old baby some hummus. We buy hummus at the store all the time but I didn't want to feed her a store bought brand as the ones...
11/10/2008,5,Awesome! We only had store bought hummus prior to this recipe and were not big fans. We really like this dip now and make it often. We followed Roy's update and we also rinsed the canned chickpe...
10/26/2008,5,I made this per the author's revised edition (found in Reviews). This is The Best Hummus I have ever tasted. I slow cooker'd garbanzo beans in salted water instead of using canned and also ende...
10/18/2008,5,This is excellent!  I have tried hummus several times but was disappointed but with the list of ingredients I should have liked it.  I guess you just have to make it yourself!  Thanks for the ...

9/23/2008,5,this is a GREAT recipe! so nice to find a hummus recipe with Tahini! this recipe also made a great base for adding ingredients. an especially yummy addition was some black greek olives. roasted ...
8/27/2008,5,Don't use liquid from can! Peeling Garbanzos is key to smooth Hummus. Added 1/4 cup veggie broth to make for missing liquid. Excellent!
8/26/2008,5,Wonderful recipe! Very easy and tastes better than anything in the store.
8/21/2008,5,I followed the updates and this turned out FANTASTIC. I had never made humus before and because this was so easy I'll never buy it from the deli again! Thanks for the great recipe!
8/18/2008,5,Yummy and easy! I substituted peanut butter for the tahini. I also only used 1 clove of garlic (I don't like a strong garlic taste). It turned out very good.
7/30/2008,5,Everyone loved this. I made it with the zesty pita chips from this site.
7/22/2008,5,We loved it and so easy!
7/1/2008,5,I really liked this one authentic and smooth.  I only have a blender not a food processor and had to work on blending my hummus with other recipes.
6/19/2008,5,This is about a million times better than store bought hummus (I think commercially prepared kinds tend to be kind of sour tasting) and really easy to make! I just finished making my second batc...
6/13/2008,5,I have been looking for tahini for months and finally found some. I made this recipe last night and it was delicious! I followed the author's updates version and the only change I made was to u...
6/10/2008,5,I halved the salt and glad I did I felt it was plenty salty.  Very garlicy!  Next time may roast it to tone down the flavor.  Will make again.
6/10/2008,5,This always comes out fantastic.  I tried oven roasting the garlic before adding it - I had to double the amount but roasting the garlic got rid of the harsh acidic flavour that fresh garlic so...
6/4/2008,5,Very good - I think maybe the salt amount would be ok if you were using the low sodium chick peas (S & W brand is what I used - excellent!) - also substituted 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil fo...
6/2/2008,5,"Fabulous!!  Why buy hummus when it's so easy to make at home?

Highly recommended. Thanks!"

5/21/2008,5,You have to use the tahini - it adds so much to this dish.  I make it and eat it right away even though it tastes better wtih a little fridge time.
5/19/2008,5,I added too many chic peas and it still tasted yummy- even my one year old liked it!  A win thank you!
5/14/2008,5,Yum!  So easy and so good.  This is a good basic hummus recipe.  Can be customized easily.  The second go round I added roasted red pepper.  Also good.

5/1/2008,5,So easy to make and just great...I thought it was even better than the hummus I usually buy from the store.
4/29/2008,5,The BEST hummus recipe I have ever had.  Make sure you use lemon juice fresh from the lemon.  Bottled lemon juice doesn't even compare.
4/24/2008,5,This is the real deal.  Restaurant quality for sure.  I add about a half a teaspoon of cumin instead of black pepper and serve it with a couple slices of lemon on the side as well as a couple d...

3/26/2008,5,This is great.  I'm Greek and this is authentic.  I cut the Tahini back a little because I don't like too much of it's flavor.  I also chopped up the garlic first and then put it in the food pro...
3/22/2008,5,The best!!!  I'll never buy store bought hummus again.  I did increase the garlic to 2 T.  Loved it!!

3/11/2008,5,First a tip for making sure you don't end up with chunks of garlic:  Blend up everything but the chickpeas for about a minute first.  I've made this recipe so many times.  When you first make i...
3/5/2008,5,I personally don't like hummus but my customers at the cafe love this.  Nice and creamy they say!
3/5/2008,5,very yummy but I would prefer with a bit less garlic.
2/28/2008,5,Fabulous and easy to modify. I really recommend Kosher salt with a larger grain and better taste than table salt. Didn't try the cumin but I'm sure it would also be great with other variations...
2/27/2008,5,Thank you for posting a recipe for real Hummus!!!!
1/27/2008,5,Awesome recipe!  Frequently requested by my 3 yr. old.
1/26/2008,5,I'm never buying store-bought hummus again. Followed the recipe as is and then just adjusted the ingredients to taste. I like a more lemony hummus so ended up adding a bit more of that. I used ...
1/21/2008,5,So flipping good.  I used the revised version given by the author. I fresh squeezed half a lemon into the mix instead of measuring it out.  Better than anything you can get in the store (and com...

6/29/2007,5,SUPER AMAZING!!!
6/8/2007,5,This really hit the spot when I was craving hummus. Great simple recipe. The only change I really made was to cut out the olive oil. I found it unneccessry because it was creamy and perfect al...

5/6/2007,5,This stuff was great!  I didn't change anything.

10/20/2006,5,"Great hummus! (my family says needs more
garlic).  I started with dry chickpeas;
I think it will take about 1 cup dry to 
make this recipe."
10/16/2006,5,Yum! I made changes as per the author's review. I only used 1/2 tsp salt and cumin to taste (and lots of it) instead of pepper. I added the liquid from the beans a little at a time until I got a...

7/21/2006,5,very easy and very good

5/1/2006,5,Home-made hummus is the only way to go! I suggest adding the lemon gradually to taste because I used the full amount the first time and it was too lemony for me. I also added more garlic and d...

4/6/2006,5,Brought this to a party with all different types of people attending.. was worried it might be too exotic but it was a huge success. People with very conservative taste buds asked me first.. w...
3/30/2006,5,This is a wonderful recipe!  My kids just love it with fresh veggies.
3/2/2006,5,absolutely amazing! like the previous post says make sure to read the original recipe poster's recipe update.
1/21/2006,5,Awesome job really important to read the early post from the chef it clarifies the whole how many cloves of garlic question especially for novice cooks like me! My friends and I loved it!...
1/17/2006,5,I omitted the salt altogether and it was still delicious!  Thanks for the recipe Richard.
1/1/2006,5,Excellent.  Absolutely excellent.  I didn't realize how easy it is to make Hummus also a ton cheaper to make it yourself.  I will make homemade Hummus from now on.  I didn't follow the instructi...
11/20/2005,5,This was great. Like everyone else I used less salt and more garlic and tahini.
11/16/2005,5,I was looking for a recipe to use up a can of chick peas.  This was great and very easy to make.  I would make this again.
10/20/2005,5,Delicious!!  Follow the original author's tips to make it more creamy - add juice from the chick pea can.
9/5/2005,5,A good solid hummus recipe. I made it just as directed and it was delicious. It did not have as much garlic or lemon as other recipes I have tried so it was less pungent--the flavors were defin...
5/11/2005,5,Like others have suggested I prefer less salt and a little more garlic.  But this is the best and easiest hummus recipe I have found.
5/4/2005,5,This is so good.  Easy to make too!!  The only thing i changed was adding a clove more garlic(personal addiction to garlic) and instead of oil I added plain fat free yogurt which gives it a rea...
4/30/2005,5,Simple to make far better than store bought and a great healthy snack with pita for the kids.  And they love it!!
4/28/2005,5,This hummus is great. I made it exactly and it turned out perfect.
3/2/2005,5,This is a beautiful simple and authentic hummus recipe... the best that I have tried to date!  As a matter of personal taste I added a 1/2 tsp of ground coriander seed to boost the lemon-ines...
12/30/2004,5,Fantastic and easy.  I used the changes suggested by the author (less salt more garlic and cumin) and it turned out wonderful.  This is the best hummus recipe I have found yet.
11/13/2004,5,This is the best hummus recipe that I have found.  Easy to prepare and stays to what I consider true hummus.
11/2/2004,5,I used extra garlic and lemon juice! Also sprinkled with some fresh parsley before serving. Very good for dipping fresh raw veggies too.
12/4/2003,5,Easy and delicious! Even a picky friend wants the recipe!
9/14/2003,5,this was a bit overwhelming at first but after a day the flavours were more subtle. This is a really great recipe but next time I will add more garlic!
7/31/2003,5,This is awesome hummus!! I love making things myself so I'm really happy to have found such a delicious recipe. Everyone said it was the best hummus they ever had. I didn't use the original rec...
5/20/2003,5,This was pretty fantastic.  I dislike store bought hummus because of it's weird consistency and this is so easy to make (and less expensive!) that I'll never buy hummus again!  I've made it twi...
4/28/2003,5,This is fabulous!!!
4/21/2003,5,This is an excellent recipe for this dish.  I found that using a blender was a bit aggravating as it's quite thick.  A food processor might work better but I don't have one.  Also I omitted t...
2/24/2003,5,Excellent recipe!  Simple straightforward; delicious as written but also an useful base recipe to get creative with.
9/11/2002,5,I can't believe I had been spending big bucks for hummus! This is fast easy inexpensive and GOOD! My whole family including my thirteen year old loves it. I didn't have any tahini in the hou...
1/7/2002,5,i used peanutbutter insread of tahini and it was fine. There was a slight peanut taste to begin with but after two bites you did not notice it.

I'm the author of this recipe and I wanted to make a few updates.  I now use cumin instead of the black pepper.  You want 2 cloves of garlic overall.  To adjust the texture betw..."
10/20/2001,5,This is the fourth hummous recipe I have tried and this is a keeper. I added more garlic and left the chickpeas slightly lumpy. GREAT
9/15/2001,5,This hummus is so yummy and easy to make!  Very authentic.
8/30/2001,5,Fabulous fabulous fabulous!  I made this for a dinner party people were so disappointed we we ran out of veggies and pita to dip in it!
8/10/2001,5,throw away all your other hummus recipes this one is the best
10/30/2017,4,id have gave it 5 but it needed tweaking with a load of extra garlic bit bland before that but wtih the added garlic just lovely :)
9/8/2017,4,Added a little less salt as the chickpea liquid already had salt added to it So simple to maketastes great A winner for sure
7/18/2017,4,This recipe is great. I was looking for a recipe to imitate a lemony hummus I had at my favorite wine bar. As is I give it 4 stars. I tasted and added some chopped flat leaf parsley and in my o...
6/25/2017,4,Good. Recipe needs more garlic.
5/27/2017,4,Used garlick powder cumin tahini cashews paprika Tabasco for a little zing and will never buy the store stuff again.
4/22/2017,4,leave the garlic out its just as good
4/20/2017,4,I didn't reserve any of the chickpeas for garnish because I'm by myself and I don't care how it looks.  However I did sprinkle some smoked paprika over the top of it which made it pretty and e...
4/19/2017,4,Easy tasty.  I would make it again.
2/26/2017,4,We are all acclimated to ace retain flavor on staples in our life like hummus and I had to add cumin to the recipe for it to hit my tastebuds just right. Thank you to the chef for sharing it is...
2/21/2017,4,super simple and tastes great. I followed the original recipes but i halfed the olive oil put on top.
2/11/2017,4,This is a simple easy-to-make recipie. I agree with the author that cumin works better than pepper although I like the pepper too. Cut back on the salt add a dash more lemon juice and this hu...
1/30/2017,4,Made it as is with 3 exceptions... 1.) Only had a 15.5 oz can of garbanzos.  2.)  I added some roasted garlic powder for more garlicky flavor and 3.) I blended the tahini with the lemon juice fi...
1/30/2017,4,I wish I would have blended it longer. I think it's a good recipe but it's true that you need to test and add. I wish I would have reserved more of the water in the can because mine came out a ...
1/26/2017,4,I would use half of the lemon juice called for a little too tangy.  Also I only use 1 clove of garlic but I see from the recipe update it should be 2. I'm going to roast the garlic first so i...

8/3/2016,4,So delicious! I added a jalepeno with the garlic before putting the chick peas in! Definitely worth it!
6/22/2016,4,Thus recipe is great. Hummus has been one of my favorite snacks for a while. I am glad I found this recipe. I did not realize how quick and easy it was to make. Also delicious.
6/16/2016,4,i added red pepper flakes to spice up.  Next I will use so much garlic.   I will make it again.
6/8/2016,4,good and refreshing!  Used 2 cloves of garlic.
5/17/2016,4,I made it light on the salt and used sea salt and added 2 jalipinos to it. Worked out fine for a first shot.Oh and a little extra garlic.I might try it again and add a avalcado...Call me crazy...
4/12/2016,4,I made this once using the recommended 19oz of beans  and the second time with a typical 15.5 oz can of beans. I definitely prefer the second batch the flavors were brighter.
4/12/2016,4,This was pretty good. Easy to put together I added a bit more olive oil. I will try cumin next time sounds very good I did add some smoked paprika for color and flavor.
4/10/2016,4,This is a super yummy base but it's very plain. Added some salsa Tabasco sauce  & Chipotle Chili Spice to kick up the heat.
1/30/2016,4,Overall this recipe is really good.  I agree with the author's comment to use cumin instead of pepper.  I use a whole teaspoon.  I also add cayenne pepper to give it a kick.  However 4 tablesp...
12/13/2015,4,I add 1/2 tsp cumin and 1 tsp sesame oil when I make the recipe. It is a very good recipe that I have made many times. It is better than any premade hummus that I have tasted. With the additions...
8/11/2015,4,I followed the suggestion to use 3 T tahini and should have tasted it first with 2 before adding the other tablespoon.  It had to much tahini for my taste.  I added a little garlic powder for mo...

7/3/2015,4,Wonderful recipe.  If you first peel the skin off each bean you will have a much smoother texture.  I also like to roast the garlic (doubled).  YUM
3/29/2015,4,This is MY recipe ;) except that I use 4 cloves of garlic in the dried garbanzos I cook. I sometimes find that the canned ones have a tinny taste. Just me maybe but in a slow cooker they cook ...
3/5/2015,4,I made this recipe exactly as written only subbing 410g boiled and drained unsalted chickpeas for the canned variety. I believe the amount of lemon is off personally. I think that 2 Tbsp of le...
3/4/2015,4,Very good.  I had. 15 oz can of the garbanzo beans so cut back just a little bit on rest of the ingredients. I did go with just 3 tablespoons of the lemon juice because I didn't want it to be to...
2/13/2015,4,I prefer 6 cloves of Garlic VS. Salt.

9/21/2014,4,The trick to hummus is the order in which you add the ingredients to the food processor. I always add equal parts lemon juice and tahini first and process it. It will whip into a thick light col...
8/2/2014,4,I tried this its great
6/29/2014,4,This is a recipe that is per your taste. but is a starter recipe. I love 2 Tbsp. garlic and 1/2 Tbsp. cumin I will chill the hummus I may have to add more cumin. Thanks Happy Cooking!
6/18/2014,4,beware of salt!  I didn't add any extra. Easy to make and tasty!
1/24/2014,4,Easy....definitely use less salt.  I thought 1 tsp was too much so I cut it down to 3/4 tsp and was still way too much.  I ended up using a 2nd can of garbanzo beans.  And definitely use a small...
1/18/2014,4,The consistency is amazing. I used the chick pea water about 2/3 of a cup I'd guess. I tried a little bit of the variation everyone wrote about with Cumin but I don't think I will again. I just ...
11/26/2013,4,Pretty good but the 3 tbsp.'s of lemon juice made it a little too lemony... I just added more salt.  Next time I'll use 2. But overall a very good recipe.
11/3/2013,4,Really good!!!
9/13/2013,4,One small issue is that I find garbanzo beans in 15.5oz cans-not 19oz. It seems like it comes out fine anyway.. I loved using the roasted and smashed (I haveno proper grinder) cumin was a very n...
7/31/2013,4,I really loved this recipe but made 2 small changes after reading some of the reviews.  I only used 3T lemon juice and 1/2tsp of salt.  For me this was plenty of tang and salt.  I gave 4 stars i...
7/21/2013,4,Great fast recipe for hummus! I tweaked it a bit (added more garlic and a small onion). I also didn't add the liquid from the beans (I like it thick).
7/7/2013,4,One more thing you can top it with a little bit of olive oil.
5/8/2013,4,It's good as it but I use it as a base and go from there. My favorite proportions are: 2 cloves garlic 1 can (15 oz.) beans 4 TB lemon 3 TB tahini salt as needed. Also I use cumin instead ...
4/26/2013,4,I make this hummus quite often. I often add roasted red peppers also. My biggest suggestion is to place the garbanzo beans in a shallow bowl of water and take the skins off the beans. Just rub t...

1/31/2013,4,I use garbanzo beans and not canned.  It's pretty basic and good.

8/6/2012,4,Good base to start. The only thing I would suggest is to totally leave out the salt it just isn't necessary with the lemon juice. I follow the rest of the recipe including the author's suggest...
7/31/2012,4,It was missing something???
7/26/2012,4,The original posted updated to say two garlic cloves are better so I used two large cloves from a head I just purchased... Way too garlicy! If your garlic isn't fresh or if cloves are smaller ...
7/19/2012,4,"Warning: Definitely use canned chickpeas and not dried/bulk ones.

5/24/2012,4,Very good.  Added a little lemon zest which gave it a very fresh flavor.
5/6/2012,4,A good starter recipe.   I did the following adjustments.   I did not add any salt or pepper used 2 cloves of garlic a half of a jalapeno seeded and used 2 heaping TB of tahini.  I did not ad...
4/22/2012,4,Pretty good. As suggested I added another clove of garlic.
4/4/2012,4,I used this as a guide but ended up adding more garlic and a lot less lemon.
4/3/2012,4,Made as per recipie decreased liquid also tried with black beans instead of chickpeas - no liquid and more garlic - wished I had cumin to add flavour.
2/18/2012,4,Raw garlic is a bit too strong for me.  I saute the two cloves of chopped garlic in the olive oil.
2/7/2012,4,My husband is from the Middle East and over the 25 yrs of our marriage I have eaten hummus from many Middle Eastern cooks. I make my own from canned garbanzo beans too. Authentic Middle Eastern...
1/11/2012,4,Used this for a catering event.  Everyone loved it!
12/31/2011,4,Very good base recipe.  Only giving 4 stars since I didnt think there was enough garlic and the amount of tahini needs to be upped.  I made 2 seperate batches the first was as written and the s...
11/13/2011,4,Excellent! I took this hummus to a potluck and everyone was asking for the recipe.  I might add a little more garlic next time but that's because I'm a garlic nut.
10/22/2011,4,Very good! I'm allergic to black pepper so I left it out.  After reading the reviews I think I will grind some cumin seeds and add to what I have left of it.  I also added a little bit of hone...
10/14/2011,4,Very good humus the second batch I didn't add the salt and it turned out much better.
10/9/2011,4,As per the original cook suggested I used cumin and no black pepper and cut the salt in half.  It was still too salty.  I will eliminate the salt next time.
10/8/2011,4,This was pretty good but the lemon flavor was really strong.  I might cut back by a tablespoon next time.  I added chopped roasted red pepper which was also good.
10/6/2011,4,Love! I used 3 cloves of garlic cut the salt in half and left out the oil. This was my first trial with homemade hummus and with this recipe it turned out great!
8/26/2011,4,This was an easy recipe and I used my dried chickpeas that i cooked in the slow cooker.  Tastes great a little thick but still awesome none the less.  I may have used more chickpeas than what...
8/2/2011,4,Good basic hummus recipe. Too salty for my taste so you may want to taste it before adding the salt. I also added about a half teaspoon each of cumin and paprika. Yum!
7/8/2011,4,The adjustments are pretty spot on the cumin really helps! It is really tasty! Can't wait to try it today with pitas-yum!
7/6/2011,4,I followed other reviewers' suggestions and halved the amount of salt the recipe called for.  My suspicion is that the author of the recipe used salt-free (or reduced salt) canned garbonzo beans...

4/26/2011,4,good recipe but we need to add more tahini sauce in lebanon we dont add pepper to the recipe.

3/28/2011,4,Reduce that salt!  I read the reviews and actually completely omitted it.  I don't like salt.  I used a 15 ounce can of beans (do they make 19 oz?) 2 tbs tahini 2 garlic cloves and the lemon ...
1/23/2011,4,This was an excellent base recipe especially noting the author's revisions.  As with any recipe you can vary to meet personal preferences quite easily and still have a very classic hummus.  Als...
1/20/2011,4,This was much closer to tasting like store-bought hummus than other recipes I've tried.  I added 1/2 jar of roasted red peppers and 3 cloves of garlic.  Next time I'll use less lemon juice.
12/3/2010,4,Delicious!  I used a 15.5 oz can of beans.  That worked well.
10/10/2010,4,Very good - with or without adding the olive oil this recipe is very good!  Easy and much better  (and cheaper) than buying store bought.  I used crushed garlic in the jar and my magic bullet a...
9/3/2010,4,A very tasty basic hummus.  I prefer a little more variety so I added some paprika and cayenne.
8/15/2010,4,I thought this was great! Way better than the store variety. I added a jalepeno to spice it up and it added a nice flavor not too hot.
8/12/2010,4,Pretty good basic recipe.
7/13/2010,4,This recipe worked great for me. The only adjustment I made was to reduce the amount of lemon juice (I'm not a big fan of tart hummus....hence 4 stars instead of 5.) I also tried a batch with ab...
6/29/2010,4,Loved it! Best homemade hummus I have ever made!
6/25/2010,4,I like to dice a small amount of jalapenos and soak them in lemon juice to add as a topping when eating hummus. I had this at a restaurant that is no longer here - Castle Cafe.
5/23/2010,4,This is a great recipe.  Instead of tahini I pan toasted seasame seeds until lightly brown and blended with a tablespoon of seasame oil.  I also used 2 tablespoons of lemon juice and a tablespo...
4/30/2010,4,At first taste this turned out AWFUL but I'm not sure it it was the recipe or not.  I think I had some not so great Olive Oil but I could also taste a little too much of the Tahini.   I salvag...
4/21/2010,4,Overall really great hummus recipe. I've made some changes that I think readers would appreciate.   Rather than using raw garlic I roast about half a  garlic clove in olive oil for 20 minutes be...
4/11/2010,4,This recipe is a great starting point.  As the author noted in his update I used cumin in place of the pepper (about 3/4t) and I also added about 1/4t cayenne pepper.  I also halved the salt b...
3/25/2010,4,Too much lemon juice!!! I halved it to only 2 T. on the second try and that nailed it. It's awesome!
3/25/2010,4,Good recipe however I did put 6-9 cloves of garlic and lots of chili and cumin and black pepper.
3/8/2010,4,Good Hummus! I like mine a little more runny so I leave all the liquid in the can of chickpeas! next time i will use a little less garlic. Fallowed the recipe precisely! and overall pretty good!
2/10/2010,4,Very good basic hummus.  I strayed only slightly from the recipe - a little more garlic and tahini and added cayenne pepper. I used cumin instead of black pepper.
1/30/2010,4,This was a fairly basic rather bland hummus as far as they go. I make hummus for my husband as I don't generally eat it (it's ok just not really my thing) & today he happened to be home whe...
1/27/2010,4,It is a good recipe but i am a garlic lover so i put in 5 cloves instead of 2 (yikes!! I know) but it tasted pretty good!
1/24/2010,4,This was my first try at hummus and it turned out pretty well.  I wanted more flavor so I added chopped fresh basil and fresh Italian parsley.  I also doubled the amount of garlic because I love...
1/17/2010,4,Oh so good!
11/29/2009,4,This is a great basic recipe quick easy and what a money-saver over store-bought hummus. I found the garlic/lemon flavor mellowed overnight. Next time I'll up the tahini and garlic and try out...
11/29/2009,4,This seems to be the best hummus so far that we made.
11/12/2009,4,Very good.  I'll never buy pre-made hummus again.  Thanks!
10/10/2009,4,I took the general idea from this recipe and then didn't reference while making it which was a bad thing. I added way too much garlic. Next time I'll actually follow the recipe.
10/9/2009,4,Didn't change much. Next time might roast the garlic next time.
10/6/2009,4,This is pretty good.  I like the little bit of cumin in it.  I use just a pinch of salt as I don't generally like my foods very salty.  Please forgive me ROYHOBBS but I couldn't find Tahini an...
9/3/2009,4,Good! This has all the right ingredients I just had to play with the amounts. I ended up using 1/4 cup lemon and 4 tbs. (1/4 cup) tahini. And HALF the salt was PLENTY. 1-2 tsp. of olive oil IN ...
8/31/2009,4,Very good! Next time I'll use a 1/2 tsp salt instead of a full tsp though slightly too salty.
8/29/2009,4,This over all is a great recipe.  But for those of you who dislike the garbonza beans and their texture.  I use Canaleni (white kidney) beans in mine and it's sooo good!!
8/27/2009,4,This hummus recipe is great! Would definitely recommend and will make again.
8/21/2009,4,Easy but bland.  Would prefer more garlic (as a personal preference).  Also recipe says to reserve juice from beans but never tells to add it back it (I did to smooth it out more).
8/1/2009,4,Pretty good.  Much better then the one that comes up top-rated on allrecipes.com.  Best I've tried so far.
7/22/2009,4,Really good but I followed the update and used cumin and added extra garlic and lemon juice to jazz it up a bit.....I'm so excited to have made hummus - thank you for the recipe!
6/6/2009,4,The hummus that I make at home is nearly the same. I don't add any salt to it though.. I either roast my garlic or put it in a pan with a little olive oil and then put it in a food processer alo...
6/4/2009,4,followed the author's adjustments added a little paprika and had me some garlicky yummy hummus.  if you cook ur own beans 1 cup dry will do.
5/20/2009,4,DELISHI ONLY ADDED 1 1/2 tsp GARLIC AND GARNISHED WITH CUMIN AND OIL.
5/18/2009,4,Simple easy classic.
4/11/2009,4,This is a great basic hummus recipe. I added more garlic (about 2.5 tbs) because I like a real garlicky hummus. Also I noticed that the longer it sits in my fridge the better it gets. :)
3/30/2009,4,Very very good.  I added an extra clove of garlic and a little more lemon.  Used water instead of liquid from beans. Cumin is a good option too but good with or without.
3/18/2009,4,I really liked this recipe! I added cumin and roasted red peppers (per other reviews) and a little bit more tahini. I had been using a recipe that called for about 3 times more tahini so this s...
3/16/2009,4,This was a good starting point for hummus but know that you'll always have to taste it and play with the ingredients to get the proportions that you like.  Everyone's different.  I never have t...
2/25/2009,4,Really tasty!  Followed the suggestion by the author to up the tahini...next time I am going to add it more slowly 3Tbsp is a lot!  Only added a dash of salt and left out the pepper entirely.  ...
2/15/2009,4,this is a fail-safe recipe for hummus.  i have tried before mulitple times but was using dry garbonzo beans instead.t   even after soaking and boiling them i just couldn't get the right consit...
1/4/2009,4,If you use canned garbanzos you should check if salt is added. I prefer to cook the dryed ones. I agree on adding the lemon (everything really) slowly and tasting- I prefer less but it's all ta...
12/9/2008,4,I thought this recipe was too garlicky and lemony. I cut back on those two ingredients and it makes a great veggie dip. Thanks for the recipe - it's so much cheaper to make it than to buy it!
12/8/2008,4,Very good hummus but I for one am not a huge fan.
11/24/2008,4,Made the recipe as is except removed the skins from the chickpeas beforehand.  At first I thought it was too lemony but the next day the flavors set in to make it much better.  Next time I wil...
10/29/2008,4,Well done. The critique from my guests was that it was a bit on the tart side. Perhaps lessen the lemon juice just a touch? Still an excellent authentic tasting entree'.
10/7/2008,4,This recipe is a good guideline to follow.  I used 2 TBS of Tahini and it was too much to my liking.  I also used 4 cloves of garlic and added italian parsley.  I added salt to taste.  Very good.
9/29/2008,4,This didn't have enough oompff for me. All I tasted was the garbanzo beans - so I doubled the tahini and the lemon juice. I don't ever use canned beans I use dried beans which I have cooked and ...
9/23/2008,4,this  is the original hummus recipe but don't use black pepper or cumin.Also tastes great if you cooked ground meat with chopped onions salt black pepper and fried pine nuts in the top.
9/1/2008,4,This is probably the best recipe for hummus on this site but you do have to make a few adjustments to make it come out right. First it is very thick so you will have to thin it out with eithe...
6/17/2008,4,This is pretty good for a hummus base even hubby likes it right when I made it.  We can't wait to taste it chilled.  One of my favorite brands of hummus from the store comes in a Greek Olive fl...
6/10/2008,4,I thought that this had a good traditional hummus taste. I used the author's updated version to include cumin instead of pepper.
5/27/2008,4,This is perfect with cumin instead of black pepper and less salt. I have a salt tooth but I have to say the salt overwhelmed the other flavours. Use half the amount and it'll be perfect. Let it...
5/26/2008,4,Some of the best hummus I've made followed the recipe pretty much to a tee...will tinker from here. Thanks!
4/16/2008,4,I like some sprinkled cilantro or parseley on top and also a dash of cayenne.
4/15/2008,4,Despite some reviews we did use peanut butter (actually we used PB2) instead of tahini. The hummus came out with great texture and flavor. I think that it is very customizable and next time I w...
3/24/2008,4,Tasted even better than the kind I buy in the store.
1/2/2008,4,I never realised how easy it was to make hummus. When I tasted this directly after making I too thought it was a bit salty. But by the time I served it at my party the following day it had lost ...
12/6/2007,4,Excellent recipe as written.
11/21/2007,4,Great super easy basic recipe. Easy to season it up to your particular taste.
10/11/2007,4,I was out of lemon juice so that's probably be why but this hummus is kid of bland. I added more garlic and that helped a little. Very quick to make except a bit difficult in the blender (mine...
9/28/2007,4,A little too much lemon for my tastes. And I only put in 3 Tbsp. I'd recommend adding the lemon to taste. Other than that it is a very good recipe.
9/24/2007,4,This is such a great base for learning how to make hummus. I tried a different recipe that I think is closer to not only a more traditional hummus but it also has more live enzymes (so its bette...
9/19/2007,4,I had a terrible time trying to make my own tahini for this but otherwise it was very good.  I blenderized and added two or three roasted red pepper slices for flavor and they added something r...
9/6/2007,4,I thought this was a great recipe.  I might add some more garlic next time as I like things very garlic-y.  I doubled the recipe and that worked fine.
8/18/2007,4,This was easy to make before company came over and everyone loved it!
7/8/2007,4,Very good hummus. I only added 3 T. of lemon juice and it was perfect. Thanks!
6/28/2007,4,This is a delicious recipe.  I added a Tbsp of honey and used the whole lemon.  I also toasted and ground whole cumin seeds for a super fresh flavour.  Adjust salt to taste.  I used only 1 Tbsp ...
5/9/2007,4,This is a pretty good starting point for hummus.  I'm giving it four stars instead of five because of the name of the recipe.  Not to be rude or anything but because it's misleading.  Hummus is...
3/26/2007,4,this is agreat base recipei added a bit more lemon to mine just perfect.
12/6/2006,4,Very good! I also added a little onion some cayenne pepper red pepper flakes cumin cilantro parsley & chives.  Next time I'll probably toss in some roasted red pepper too.
11/21/2006,4,Great hummus after a couple modifications: I omitted the garbanzo liquid and added a roasted red pepper.      Zesty dynamite!
9/26/2006,4,Both taste- & expensewise this is a far better choice than store-bought hummus.  As suggested I used only 1/2 tsp salt as well as added (to taste) some spices I had lying about (in this case...
7/27/2006,4,This recipe was pretty good.  I added 2 15oz cans of garbanzo beans since I couldn't find a 19oz can.  I left everything else the same except I added an extra clove of garlic.  I should have use...
5/23/2006,4,I really enjoyed this recipe and the second time I made it added a 1/2 jar of roasted peppers.  Very yummy and easy.
5/20/2006,4,I thought this was a little bland but it was a good starter.  It would be excellent with extra spices or herbs.
4/7/2006,4,I've made this several times most recently last week for a neighbors daughter and the two of them ended up eating the whole container with crackers and skipped dinner!  Sometimes I add cayenne...
4/2/2006,4,This is my recipe and when I made it again I found that it does have too much salt and that I needed to add olive oil and water to the mixture in the food processor I made a small batch of it.
7/31/2005,4,Great simple recipe
6/13/2005,4,A good basic hummus recipe.  My Syrian girlfriend makes the world's best hummus but she just 'eyeballs' her ingredients.  This recipe gave me a good starting point to go from.  Check the author...
5/17/2005,4,I replaced the salt with just a dash of basil and added an extra clove of garlic and it was delicious.  It's really great used as a dip for raw vegetables especially carrots and celery.
8/5/2002,4,This is an excellent hummus recipe.  Especially good as a sandwich spread!
10/17/2017,3,Ddm
9/11/2017,3,Too much lemon for my taste preference.
7/31/2017,3,Never heard of the Hummus recipe with only 2 tblsp of Tahini .
3/25/2017,3,it is really bland needs something.. I had to spice it up and I even used my own fresh cooked garbonzo beans and fresh tahini...
6/27/2016,3,use half a tsp of salt and it'll turn out fine
6/5/2016,3,While it was nice and creamy the flavor didn't wow me. I would have more garlic and less tahini and something else but what?
4/11/2016,3,Needs about 0-50% of the salt but good.  I didn't use the pepper but could see where cumin would be good.
5/13/2015,3,Authentic or real hummus is made with dry chick peas that you soak. Just soak overnight.  Out of a can is not the best tasting.  Otherwise the recipe is good. I'm middle eastern and there are ma...
2/4/2015,3,Pour off all of the liquid from the garbanzo beans in order to keep a thicker consistency.
5/26/2014,3,The overall flavor was ok but I kept thinking something was missing and the it was way too salty.
5/21/2014,3,I'd recommend useing about 1/3 to 1/4 of the salt this recipe calls for... or even omit it entirely. I had to add a whole additional can of chickpeas just to make it palatable.
2/10/2014,3,This was okay but the lemon juice was too much. I'll stick with my regular recipe from now on.
1/30/2014,3,Humus was great! But it was too salty! I too had to throw it away...maybe a different type of salt like kosher it's ok 1 teaspoon...but not regular table salt.
1/22/2014,3,It's on track but the garlic and salt taste were really overwhelming for our family. We eat hummus nearly every day so I decided to make our own. To adjust for our taste we added an additiona...
1/3/2014,3,Very bland as first written. I ended up tripling everything but the garbanzo beans.
9/8/2013,3,Too much lemon juice!
6/7/2013,3,It really was very salty possibly because of using the reserved chick pea liquid. If I make it again I will use water.
4/6/2013,3,"I tried this as written and it was just OK.  After reading several of the other user's reviews I decided to make the following changes:

- Nuke the chickpeas in the microwave for three minutes...."
3/5/2013,3,Great taste with minor adjustments
2/20/2013,3,I guess this hummus recipe was okay...  I added a change to the second batch I made because the first batch was too... Canned Food tasting. The change was that I used freshly cooked non-canned...
10/27/2012,3,"Used 2 cans of organic garbanzo beans lots of cumin and most if the liquid from
1 of the cans of beans.  This isn't amazing but a starring point for something that could be tasty."
8/10/2012,3,WAYYYY TOO MUCH SALT REQUIRED.
8/2/2012,3,great recipe
6/13/2012,3,I guess I am used to store bought hummus and this didn't taste anything like it! I am not giving up yet I think I will play with it and add some other ingredients.
3/5/2012,3,Way too much lemon juice. I think it would be good otherwise.
2/2/2012,3,This hummus is allright i dont think i would make this again
9/15/2011,3,It needs more lemon juice.
9/4/2011,3,This hummus was a little bland for me. I added a little more lemon juice and would recommend adding paprika or other spice.
8/13/2011,3,Was ok not the perfect hummus recipe that I'm looking for.
1/30/2011,3,Next time only half the salt. Great smooth texture. Added an extra clove of garlic and cumin as the original recipe writer suggested in the reviews. I only added about a 1/4 cup of reserved liqu...
12/31/2010,3,This was pretty good. I followed the original submitter's revised instructions. It's just frustrating that you have to dig through the reviews to find the real recipe so to speak. It was hard...
7/17/2010,3,Too bland for my liking. But would be great for the people who like bland.
2/11/2010,3,Well... I ran out of lemon juice and olive oil so I could only use 2 Tbl. of lemon juice and only about 1-1/2 Tbl. olive oil. Needless to say it wasn't very good. Next time I'll be sure to have...
9/13/2009,3,Tasted like lemon juice. I've never had real hummus that tasted like lemon juice.
1/24/2009,3,Just ok...
12/27/2008,3,This turned out well the first time I made it but not in the subsequent tries. It tasted good but the consistency was too watery.
1/16/2008,3,This is a good foundation but it was way too salty for my taste.  I would recommend blending all the ingredients first and then add salt to taste.  I also cut back on the lemon and just used 2 t...
12/30/2007,3,I wish I read the below review before making this!  It was definitely too salty and perhaps had a bit too much lemon in it.  But it was really easy to make and cheaper than buying it in the st...
7/30/2007,3,This was just ok.  I made it twice the first time I followed directions exactly and 4 tablespoons lemon juice (used fresh-squeezed) is way too much.  It tasted more like a ‘lemon dip’ than anyt...
4/17/2007,3,Most cans of garbanzo beans come in a 15 1/2 oz. size so you will need to buy 2 cans.  I didn't realize that I had only used 15 1/2 oz. until after I made it.  It was definitley too salty!  How...
2/3/2007,3,i hadnt read the update when i read this but yes it needs more garlic and tahini but its edible! (as my meat eating vegi hateing hubby says)
7/9/2005,3,Too salty.  Reduce to 1/2 tsp.
3/19/2017,2,Too much lemon! I would try it either with no lemon or 1 T of lemon juice next time.  All I can taste is lemon.
6/3/2016,2,This is far NOT the original....
1/18/2016,2,It looked good great texture but way waaaaay too salty sorry... I should had read your update review ...besides I purchased those bagged nabisco Pita chips which turned out to be super salty t...
8/8/2014,2,I tried the recipe because I had gotten addicted to the hummus at the grocery store and this didn't taste very similar to that or as good.  I usually expect homemade recipes to taste better tha...
5/30/2014,2,It was severly underseasoned. I used the juice and zest from an entire lemon before i was satisfied. I also added sage and paprika to make it more interesting. I would absolutely reccomend uppin...
3/19/2014,2,Wayyyyyy too salty. Amd I never say that!
8/27/2013,2,For my taste three tablespoons of lemon juice was way too much. I'm sure it's an acquired taste.
6/6/2013,2,Way too salty...I have to say that I had to tweak this recipe based on the saltiness. I will have to try this again with the suggestions of other reviewers.
2/20/2013,2,WAY too salty.
4/20/2012,2,I just tried this today following everything listed (except I went half tsp of salt and added cumin) used my blender and it barely got through blending all of it...as a result it all came out ...
11/5/2011,2,I did not like this at all.  I think it would have been better with roasted garlic and less lemon juice.  Between the raw garlic and the lemon juice it was overly acidic.  Normally I love lemon ...
9/12/2010,2,Very bland. Needs some more seasoning for flavor. Will try other variations on recipe for next time.
12/22/2009,2,I did not care for this recipe.
8/17/2009,2,Here's the real recipe and it's really easystep by step all in a food processor.Make Tahini: 2 shaker-sized containers toasted sesame seeds and about 1/2C.EVOO.LIQUEFY. Next add up to 1 full b...
11/23/2008,2,Just a bit too bland and dry for my liking.
12/28/2007,2,Did not like this recipe.  Very salty and tasted too much like the tahini paste.  I will try again but next time I will not add salt until the end and will cut back on the tahini paste.
4/22/2007,2,WAY too salty
1/11/2007,2,I thought this was bland and I needed to add more oil to make it creamy. I added parsley to mine and a little tumeric
12/21/2006,2,I'm hoping that this will taste really great tomorrow since Hummus does have a tendency to be better the next day.  Its missing something and I'm not sure what it is.  I followed the recipe pr...
7/7/2017,1,Too salty and not creamy enough.  Threw it away.
6/20/2017,1,Total disaster. Way to salty and I only use 3/4th of the recommended and it was really dry and lacking seasonings.
1/19/2017,1,The garlic and lemon flavor were way too strong and the salt was overbearing. I would suggest you not add as many extra ingredients with less salt and just add a tiny bit of lemon if any.
11/8/2014,1,I'm sorry I was not a fan even with the adjustments from the author's comment. Not for me
10/28/2011,1,Not bad if you like canned beans.  I don't like the texture.  You can soak and cook beans pretty easily for a much more authentic real Hummus.  I also add a bit of cumin and an additional clov...
9/25/2011,1,No offense to people who love this. I did not care for this recipe and i would not recommend it! ;0
11/14/2009,1,The flavor was a bit sour or bitter... and it came out too runny.
3/3/2009,1,I did not care for this hummus I am so disappointed! I spent half an hour just trying to get it to be smooth what a nightmare! This is too lemony! I even roasted some of my garlic to make it t...
1/30/2009,1,I thought I had misread the lemon juice ingredient as the first taste was so sour and lemony it was inedible.  I added more of the garbanzo beans and tahini and eventually it tasted just fin...
10/22/2008,1,This was horribly bland. I had to add garlic (2T chopped) and chili powder (1/4 tsp) to get it to taste like anything. The recipe also called for half the liquid reserved but then didn't say w...
10/28/2003,1,This recipe was a disaster; it was way too salty too lemony and was a strange consistency.  Save time and money and don't bother with this one.
8/1/2002,1,I'm sorry but this was a disaster the salt was so strong that we ended up trashing it
5/18/2013,5,The perfect meatball!
5/15/2013,5,I made this recipe last night for dinner & these meatballs are hands down the BEST meatballs I've ever made!
5/12/2013,5,The boys loved these! They were easy I like that I didn't have to have eggs to make them and even though I had to make some adjustments (toasted bread turned into bread crumbs since we were out...
5/10/2013,5,This is so simple and SO good! I've made these three or four times now and used them for lots of different things. Everyone who tries them loves them!! Thanks so much!!
5/9/2013,5,BEST MEATBALLS EVER.
4/25/2013,5,Awesome meatballs.  And yes I did add a little black pepper and used a little italian sausage too.
4/24/2013,5,I have made these meatballs at least 10 times and stick to the recipe for the most part.  The only thing I may change is that sometimes I will use turkey  beef and add some sausage in too.  B...
4/22/2013,5,EXCELLENT!  Use a little less red pepper than the recipe calls for.  Perfect!
4/21/2013,5,These were absolutely divine!  The entire family enjoyed these.  Even my picky 8 year old gave this a thumbs up.  The only change I made was to use half ground beef and half ground pork.
4/19/2013,5,I made it as written and they were delicious in my sauce.  Planning to make them again for meatball hoagies!
4/17/2013,5,HUBBY LOVED THESE!  I expected my husband to tell me that these meatballs were not seasoned to his liking since there is no Lawry's Seasoned Salt in them. However he ate 6-8 of these immediatel...
4/16/2013,5,Fantastic and easy!  Used meatloaf mix instead of lean ground beef.  Should have read the reviews and doubled the recipe to freeze
4/15/2013,5,I thought I followed the recipe but maybe I added a little more red pepper flakes than suggested because they were SPICY! My husband and I loved them -- very flavorful!
4/10/2013,5,Making these for dinner tonight. OMG! NOM NOM NOM!!!! I had to get out of the kitchen before I ate them all. Got them simmering right now in some Newman's Own Sockarooni sauce. I substituted t...
4/10/2013,5,Yummy! Made as instructed except for excluded the hot sauce and used a little less than a 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper instead of red pepper flakes.
4/2/2013,5,Love this! These are my go to meatballs! They are pretty spicy so for kids I just leave out the red pepper flakes and they are still amazing!
4/1/2013,5,I had some ground beef I needed to use up and found this recipe so I decided to try it.  I did not use the Italian seasoning or oregano because I used Italian Style Panko Breadcrumbs.  I only us...
3/31/2013,5,These were the best meatballs I ever had!  I forgot the worcestershire sauce and I used basil instead of oregano but OMG.  This is crazy good!!!
3/30/2013,5,The PERFECT meatball... finally!  LOVE the extra kick that the red pepper flakes and Frank's brings.  A little too salty for my taste... I'll reduce the sea salt to a pinch next time.  Thank y...
3/30/2013,5,loved this recipe!! used the meatballs to make meatball sandwiches and it turned out great. will make again
3/29/2013,5,I did tweak this recipie a bit.  I knew 12 meatballs would only last about an hour in my house and I wanted some for the freezer. I added 1 lb. of italian sausage and 1 lb of veal.  I read an ar...
3/26/2013,5,Only complaint is too many onions easily remedied. DELICIOUS! I'm now using parts of this recipe in my homemade hamburgers.
3/24/2013,5,Wow these are good! I have always purchased 'homemade meatballs' from the gourmet section of our local grocer since they were better than my recipe...until these! They have a ton of flavor and ...
3/23/2013,5,I first made this recipe about two years ago. Since then I've remade it dozens of times. My family loves it. I've played with it using white bread instead of the bread crumbs and it always turn...
3/22/2013,5,we all loved it! i just took out the onion because of the kids.
3/20/2013,5,Used deer meat because...well...we are hunters. Guess what? FABULOUS! We were worried using deer meat because it sometimes doesn't work for some recipes. However this was fabulous 100%! Followe...
3/18/2013,5,This was so quick and easywhich in our busy household is a must. It will now become a staple meatball recipe. The entire family loved it.
3/16/2013,5,"This is by far the best meatball recipe EVER!  I can't stop eating them. My picky teenager (the one who doesn't eat anything unless it will survive the nuclear holocaust) will eat them!
I added ..."
3/15/2013,5,I love this recipe!! I discovered it a couple months ago and have been addicted ever since! I changed up the recipe a little and instead of baking them I put them in a saucepan with broth and...
3/7/2013,5,So the first time I made this I changed it up a lot and this time I followed it exactly except for not using onion since I didn't have any. Amazing! Very very good. Added a lot of Tabasco and...
3/7/2013,5,Very good taste.
3/5/2013,5,Love this recipe! My Italian friends agree that this has that authentic flavor! I used parmesan flakes to give a nice cheesy pull with every bite! Also tried a 1/4 cup milk and a 1/4 cup sour cr...
3/4/2013,5,We loved these! They will now be my go-to meatball recipe. I made them as-is and didn't tweak the recipe beyond being liberal with the spicy stuff -- we like our food with a kick in the face.
3/2/2013,5,Yum!  These were so good.  I made meatball sandwiches out of them and my husband ate what was leftover plain for lunch the next day.  Next time I will double the recipe and freeze the rest.
2/28/2013,5,I have waited all 61 years of my life for a perfect meatball...not too wet not too dry!!!  Thank you.
2/27/2013,5,These are the best homemade meatballs I've ever had - and I come from a long background of Italian food snobs!  I have made substitutions several times depending on what I might have available ...
2/25/2013,5,This is a 5 star recipe! I did have to alter the recipe a bit but it turned out fantastic. I did not add any hot sauce and used 3 garlic cloves instead of garlic salt. I also added a heaping tab...
2/24/2013,5,Cannot believe how moist these are with the lean ground beef!  Loved them - will absolutely make this recipe again!  Only ended up cooking for 15 mins but maybe mine were smaller than they were ...
2/22/2013,5,My husband and I love this recipe! It works just as well with ground turkey too!
2/21/2013,5,Awesome! Roughly measured seasonings used sourdough bread. Served with homemade marinara sauce.
2/19/2013,5,I don't eat beef but wanted some good meatballs for my beef-eating family. I used panko crumbs because they are just simple ingredients: wheat flour dextrose yeast salt (the regular bread cr...
2/19/2013,5,Used this recipe as my base. Modifications I made are: used 1/2 lean beef and 1/2 ground pork deleted sea salt and garlic salt (but used garlic and onion powder) and used a mix of fresh grated ...
2/18/2013,5,A staple in my house. Triple the batch and freeze for quick meals later.
2/17/2013,5,fantastic!  Used A-1 b/c no worcestershire sauce.  Added pizza sauce poured over top of meatballs & w/ 5 min. left added Italian cheese blend over sauce.  = AWESOME!  Pizza Meatballs w/ some zip...
2/17/2013,5,I used this recipe for the first time yesterday to make spaghetti and meatballs. I didn't have any Worcestershire sauce which I know for a fact would have been great but the meatballs turned o...
2/17/2013,5,Perfectly easy and tasty meatball recipe! I ran out of bread crumbs (I was making this with 5# of meat! Yielding around 150 meatballs) so I subbed some Ritz crackers. Using a cookie scoop to for...
2/14/2013,5,I loved the texture of these meatballs as I was making them. I used a saute pan instead of oven to brown. Great taste.
2/14/2013,5,i tried this recipe for the first time it was easy and so delicious
2/13/2013,5,Very yummy! I made these for the first time tonight. While they were baking the whole house smelled wonderful. The Worcestershire sauce and red pepper flakes really make these taste fantastic. ...
2/13/2013,5,This is my go to meatball recipe now. Always makes a delicious moist meatball.  I do add an egg for extra protein and I subbed yogurt for milk since I had extra on hand (plain).
2/11/2013,5,I loved this recipe but I didnt make the meatballs I made meatloaf and it was GREAT!
2/10/2013,5,When a recipe comes out great the first time it makes me so happy!  I got the highest praise from hubby who said they are better than his.  I guess I did make a few changes now that I think on i...

8/8/2012,5,These were a huge hit at my house.  Even my extremely picky 6 year old asks for these now. You can adjust some of the ingredients as preferred. I like the bit of the hot sauce and red pepper fla...
8/7/2012,5,These meatballs have great flavor and are easy to make.  I didn't add the dash of hot pepper sauce and thought they added just enough kick with the red pepper flakes.
8/7/2012,5,These meatballs were delicious! My husband and I loved them. I cooked them in the oven for 15 minutes before adding it to The Best Marinara Sauce Yet listed here on the site to finish cooking....
8/3/2012,5,AWESOME!! The only thing I changed was that I left out the red pepper and pepper sauce bc we don't like things too hot. Other than that I prepared them exactly as written. I will definitely make...
7/27/2012,5,Great simple recipe. Made 'em for the in-laws even our 3yr old liked them. She'd like them more if they were a little less spicey. I'd like more. But that's the great thing about this recipe ...
7/24/2012,5,Very tasty!
7/23/2012,5,"Wow!  I hate meatballs these were the best!  Instead of milk I used one egg and homemade breadcrumbs.
The whole family said that these were the best meatballs they have eaten.  A keeper!  Thx f..."
7/20/2012,5,I've made this several times.  Tonight I used half beef and half pork.  I use very little red pepper flake and no hot sauce.  Tonight I was out of Worcestershire sauce!  Who runs out of that!  I...
7/18/2012,5,My first time making meatballs this recipe was perfect I did'nt have to adjust a thing. Flavorful and juicy!
7/18/2012,5,These were delicious!! The only thing I would change is to cook them in marinara sauce for a few minutes after they finished baking in the oven. Other than that we all loved them!!
7/17/2012,5,These were tasty!  Flavors and texture were fantastic.  The red pepper and hot sauce does add a kick but I wouldn't change it.  I topped with my all time favorite pasta sauce:  World's Best Pas...
7/12/2012,5,Awesome!!!
7/11/2012,5,very easy to prepare and extremly delicious!
7/10/2012,5,Yum yum yum! Made a bunch for my hubby who lives to have bucatini and meatballs after hockey tuesday nights. Instead of buying the frozen ones I always do I thought I would give these a try. So ...
7/10/2012,5,I cook these meatballs exactly like the recipe says and they are a hit for 10 or 80 people.  I have noticed they are really spicy meatballs if I use Cholula versus Red Hot. It's really delicio...
7/9/2012,5,Very good recipe and very easy.  Mine would have been so much better if I'd remembered to turn them over halfway through!  Other than that they were delicious!

6/29/2012,5,Greateasy to make and very flavorful!
6/27/2012,5,Tried these tonight and even though I didn't have Italian seasoning they were delicious! Probably the best meatballs I have ever tasted and definitely the best I have ever made! Yummy!
6/25/2012,5,This came out great. I think onions should be minced not diced. And i substituted olive oil for skim milk. Absolutely fantastic.
6/24/2012,5,Super yummy!  A lot like my mom's recipe only with a nice extra kick!  Hubby really liked them too.
6/22/2012,5,I did a 2:1 ratio of ground chuck/ground pork for these and they were amazing!  Will definitely be making a double batch soon to freeze for quick meals in the future.
6/21/2012,5,These are delicious!  I used oatmeal instead of the bread crumbs because I don't care for the bread crumb texture.  Also line your baking sheet with parchment paper so the meatballs don't stick...
6/20/2012,5,My husband loved them! Thank you.
6/19/2012,5,Loved.  I didn't have onion so I used onion powder and added a little EVOO to the mix.  And a tiny bit more red pepper.  Excellent!
6/18/2012,5,I really questioned whether nirvana could be reached through meatball and I must say it was awfully close with this recipe.  Super moist/juicy flavorful with a little spicy kick.  I loved thes...
6/17/2012,5,This recipe was wonderful! I made it tonight for guests and everyone loved them. I omitted the hot sauce (didn't have any) and didn't use garlic salt just garlic powder but other than that le...

6/5/2012,5,Thank you for this recipe...these meatballs are awesome! Love that they are baked instead of fried. I used ground turkey (what I had) and garlic powder instead of garlic salt because sea salt ca...
6/2/2012,5,Simple to make and delicious!
6/1/2012,5,yummmy great recipe had to change some things but still turned out great!
6/1/2012,5,I used this meatball recipe for the meatballs called in meatball minestrone (also from this site). The only changes I made were no onions and no milk (didn't have any on hand!)
6/1/2012,5,These are absolutely amazing. I followed the recipe exactly and was surprised by how flavorful these were. They freeze and reheat very well too!
5/31/2012,5,Nice and moist you can really taste the parmesan...mmmm!  Made with Aunt Cathy's meatball sauce May 2012
5/29/2012,5,Just came out of the oven and they are amazing! I did add in italian sausage only because I already had it defrosted!
5/27/2012,5,These meatballs are great !!!!!  I've used this recipes many times.. My family loves them. I'll be using this one from now on.
5/24/2012,5,This is wonderful! I can't believe I can make insanely delicious meatballs right in my own apartment and I can't believe that it's really simple.  Thanks for broadening my repertoire with this ...
5/23/2012,5,Hubby LOVES these to the extent that he no longer wants regular spaghetti sauce without these meatballs!  Very tasty!
5/22/2012,5,The best way to describe this is perfect!  I doubled the recipe and it was still perfect.  I intended to freeze the extra meatballs but yeah that didn't happen. :)
5/21/2012,5,These are so good!I use ground Turkey and extra Parmesan- plus a little green onion. Plain breadcrumbs work just fine with these changes. Very flavorful and tender.
5/16/2012,5,YUM!!!
5/13/2012,5,Loved this recipe! I didn't have seasoned bread crumbs but I did have Planko so I used that instead and same with the milk I used greek yogurt. It came out so tasty!

5/4/2012,5,delicious! didn't have the sea salt but other than that followed recipe pretty closely. Just great! Ate them by themselves with a side of pasta.
5/3/2012,5,I just love these meatballs!  I only use half of the red pepper flakes and hot sauce to make them a bit more mild.  Usually I make four times the recipe at once...I have a lot of mouths to feed.
4/30/2012,5,These were delicious! I omitted red pepper flakes because I have a 2 year old who doesn't like anything spicy and they were still fantastic! We will be making these on a regular basis.
4/25/2012,5,Even when I choose recipes that have been rated highly I always look through some of the reviews to see what suggestions others have to make it better. For this 1 I couldn't find any suggestio...

3/25/2012,5,These are really outstanding in flavor and texture - yum.  However they were so tender mine fell a little bit apart.  Still outstanding.
3/23/2012,5,Great recipe! I only put in half the amount of red pepper flakes and no hot sauce and it was plenty of spiciness for me (I like things mild and not very spicy). Doubled the recipe and it made 30...

3/4/2012,5,I didn't have any hot sauce so left that out.  I also didn't realize I was out of worcestershire sauce so I used steak sauce in place of it.  These were DELICIOUS!  Cooked perfectly in 25 minu...
3/4/2012,5,This has now replaced my once favorite meatball recipe.  I have made these three times now and they are fantastic.  I double everything with just a few minor changes.
3/3/2012,5,I prepared these almost as described except I added chopped Serrano chiles as well as chopped chives. Then I used an egg and 2 tbl spoons of 2% milk vs. the skim milk.. then I baked them in my c...

11/20/2011,5,These are the best meatballs ever! I've made them a few times and multiply the recipe by 5x so have plenty to freeze and give away. The red pepper and hot sauce add just the right amount of zing...

10/30/2011,5,This is an AMAZING recipe! I suggest cooking them for at least 25 minutes any less and they are a bit mushy :)
10/29/2011,5,My husband and father in-law both said that this was the best meatball of their lives.  For me it wasn't the best - but I will defer to their experience in this review.

4/2/2011,5,I am not rating the taste because I used pre-seasoned hot italian chicken sausage instead of beef so I didn't add any spices to it.  (Amazing that way...)  But I am rating this on the texture an...

3/26/2011,5,Very moist! I did add 1/2 cup diced red bell pepper and one egg (I've never made meatballs without an egg). A very simple and delicious recipe!
3/25/2011,5,So good.  I made the balls the night before we wer planning on having these for dinner and then baked them in the morning.  For dinner all we had to do was reheat the meatballs in some marinara...

3/24/2011,5,Nice consistency. Flavorful a little hot maybe too much for the faint of heart.  If spicy doesn't suit you I'd leave out the red pepper flakes.

3/5/2011,5,Super easy & delicious. I added fresh crushed garlic but I always do. These meatballs turned out moist and held together very well.
3/3/2011,5,These turned out quite well. For the most part I stuck to the recipe except that I used turkey ground and so also did not use Worcestershire because I wasn't sure how well it would pair.
3/2/2011,5,*****  I just had to post a review.  These meatballs were absolutely delicious.  I normally use eggs in my meatballs and thought it was a little strange to just use milk but I made them as writ...

2/23/2011,5,These are delicious!  I make them with a little less oregano than called for.  This recipe has become a staple in our house.  I serve them on garlicky sandwich rolls with marinara sauce.
2/21/2011,5,Added real garlic and used half ground pork along with ricotta cheese then put some cayenne in there to kick it up a notch. Excellent...
2/20/2011,5,These were really tasty. I made them with red sauce but I think they could be as good on their own as bite size appetizers.

12/12/2010,5,I used ground turkey in this recipe and it was great! The turkey held together just fine.

12/8/2010,5,These were good. The only problem I had was that I seemed to put too much onion. It says one small onion and apparently my onion was not small enough. Other than that very tasty.
12/8/2010,5,I have now made these 3 times and we love them. I usually use ground turkey over beef for lower fat content and they are great anyway. I have made them with spaghetti and sauce and also with ...

11/28/2010,5,My hubby and I enjoyed this! It was flavorful. I was surprised that it held together with no eggs. That's a GOOD thing because that's one less ingredient to use. Great recipe all around!!
11/27/2010,5,My wife and I loved this recipe. I omitted the hot sauce though since my wife wouldn't like it. I've made multiple times and this is good with turkey meat too.

5/13/2010,5,These were absolutely delicious!!  My husband and I think most recipes are under-seasoned so we increased the amounts of most of the ingredients.  We also think you can never have too much onio...
5/13/2010,5,Need to add a spaghetti or marinara sauce
5/12/2010,5,I loved this I have never made meatballs before and my family adored this thankyou I will be cooking this again and again and again

5/9/2010,5,WOW! These were amazing! Made them for dinner and my husband couldn't get enough.  :)  I felt that they had a lot of oregano flavor though...but my husband loves oregano so he thought they were ...
5/9/2010,5,Really good family meal.
5/8/2010,5,I have been looking for a meatball recipe that didn't taste like just lumps of ground beef.  This recipe is delicious.  I followed the recipe exact except for using half ground beef half pork a...
5/7/2010,5,This recipe is amazing... took out the onions and used BW3's HOT sauce! Next time I am making a double batch!
5/6/2010,5,I followed the recipe exactly (as I always do the first time) and it turned out great. I had my older son who is 7 try the first meatball and he said they were the best ever! Will definitely mak...
5/6/2010,5,Wonderful recipe...I substituted lean ground veal for the beef and they turned out moist .
5/5/2010,5,I normally do not like meatballs but these really were good. I put some sweet thai chilly dipping sauce on the side which complimented the hot sauce in the meatballs well.
5/5/2010,5,Great start but add 1# of Italian sausage and use fresh basiloregano and Italian parsley. If your going to use fresh herbs double the amount suggested in recipe. I also double the amount of che...
5/5/2010,5,Love'em!  I doubled and used half beef and half pork and granulated garlic instead of garlic salt.  I also omitted the hot sauce but love the red pepper flakes.  I omitted the oregano...the Ital...
5/4/2010,5,I've made these several times with great results. I made them for my entire family this past Christmas Eve and they went fast!
5/4/2010,5,Rarely give 5 starts but this one is a keeper.   I liked it all by itself without any sauce.  Delicious... followed recipe without any changes.  Even good cold the next day.
5/1/2010,5,Good meatballs!  I doubled the recipe and froze half of them.  I used 1 lb of ground pork and 1 lb of hamburger.  I also used Ricotta cheese instead of the skim milk based on someone's recommend...
4/30/2010,5,Thank you! first time in 10 years my husband liked the meatballs that I ve made!
4/29/2010,5,This recipe uses a wonderful blend of spices. The meatballs hold together nicely. The only thing I would do different is to occasionally turn the meatballs because they can get stuck to the pan ...
4/28/2010,5,Very good.....didn't have the Worcestershire so I used Soy and cut down on the salt.  Good reviews.....yum.
4/27/2010,5,Very good. I may use half the pepper flakes next time. I will be using this recipe next time I am making meatball subs. They are much better than the supermarket wheatballs in a bag.
4/27/2010,5,YUM!  These were great with red sauce and spaghetti and would make amazing meatball subs.  My daughter also enjoyed them dipped in her favorite condiment she calls 'Metchup' (ketchup & mustard ...
4/27/2010,5,This is a very good easy recipe.  The only thing I didn't add was the hot pepper sauce and crushed red pepper flakes but other than that I followed this recipe completely.  I cooked them in s...
4/25/2010,5,I have made this three times each time better than the last. I have changed it some but the way it was written is truly outstanding. I reduced the pepper flakes to 1/2 tsp. and did away with th...
4/22/2010,5,OK...these are the best meatballs ever bar none. I used half ground beef & half sweet Italian sausage and decided to take the advice of the reviewer who recommended ricotta cheese in place of t...
4/22/2010,5,BEST MEATBALL EVER!! Thank you for the recipe!!
4/22/2010,5,Seriously good recipe. I only cut back on the spicy additions and used fresh garlic as I didn't have garlic salt otherwise made as written. Moist and full of flavor. Will make these again!
4/22/2010,5,SO GOOD!  I made these last night and talk about the best meatball subs ever.  The only thing I did differently was to grate the onions rather than dice them since my husband doesn't like chunk...
4/22/2010,5,This is a great recipe. I made exactly as written and I'll need to adjust the seasonings for personal taste next time but they are good! Thanks!
4/21/2010,5,Great! I omitted the hot sauce and red pepper added two tablespoons of romano cheese and one beaten egg.  The outcome was excellent. Instead of baking them I cooked the meatballs in the Chunk...
4/20/2010,5,Kevin thought these rocked.
4/20/2010,5,Absolutely awesome! I made 2 pounds of meatbals and we ate them with pasta and as sandwiches all week.
4/19/2010,5,Great recipe....nice little kick with the red pepper flakes and hot pepper sauce.  I didn't change a thing!!!!  Thanks
4/18/2010,5,The Best Meatballs Ever!!!  I didn't change a thing and they were awesome!
4/18/2010,5,Great!! Love them. Next time I might reduce the oregano.  I think the Italian seasoning and seasoned bread crumbs are enough herbs but I still loved them.
4/18/2010,5,Made these with ground turkey-otherwise kept everything the same. EXCELLENT!! Only wish I had made more- the next time I will. Made the Best Marinara Sauce Yet recipe from this site and mad...
4/17/2010,5,REALLY GREAT MEATBALLS!!!  The only thing I would change next time I make them is not to cook them as long as I did.  Turn them over after 10 minutes and you should be able to tell how much long...
4/17/2010,5,Substituted ground turkey for the lean ground meat and followed recipe exactly with the exception of the crushed red pepper flakes (non in pantry).  Think this is definitely my new meatball re...
4/15/2010,5,The flavor is out of sight! We really liked them and we would have liked them much better if they hadn't over-cooked. :(  I followed directions but dropped 25 deg because I have convection oven....
4/15/2010,5,That's a spicy meatball!! Delicious. Lots of flavor and can't wait to taste it after 24 hours of the flavor marrying. I probably added a little more hot sauce than I should have but they really ...
4/15/2010,5,GREAT MEATBALL RECIPE. THANKS FOR SHARING!
4/15/2010,5,Yes!  Finally!  Found my go-to meatball recipe!  These were fantastic.  Cooked them up and make mouth watering meatball subs.  Great flavor!  The only things I did differently was substitute 2 c...

4/12/2010,5,I made this yesterday and LOVED IT!  But I always have to make some changes to make it more mine.  I added a 1/2 lb of Italian Sausage to it I didn't have garlic salt so I used garlic powder u...
4/11/2010,5,Fantastic. Easy and quick. Changes? 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes (personal taste); 1/2 tsp garlic powder (that's what I had; 1/2 tsp onion flakes instead of onion (personal taste). Personally I th...
4/11/2010,5,These meatballs were unbelieveable!  It could be a great meatloaf recipe too with added egg!
4/10/2010,5,Fabulous!  Only change I made was to use ground turkey instead of beef.  Loved the kick these had!  Baked them for 20 minutes and they came out perfectly.  Thanks for a great recipe LTH!!
4/9/2010,5,This recipe was fairly simple. My husband gives them a 5/5 rating.  I used ground turkey and decided to make really large meatballs.  I also chose to replace the milk with egg I couldn't really...
4/8/2010,5,I used ground turkey for these meatballs and served them with pasta and sauce. They were excellent!
4/8/2010,5,Absolutely fantastic!  Best meatballs I have EVER eaten. The flavor is phenomenal!  Followed recipie as is except for MORE hot sauce/chillies (as I am a chili junkie).  This is a real keeper.  L...

4/8/2010,5,Wow! Another great recipe from this site that will go into the monthly rotation....Firm meatballs with a slight hint of heat. My hubby already asked me to make these again..only next time melt s...
4/8/2010,5,YUM!  The very best meatballs I've ever made by a long shot.  So much flavor!  My partner & I eat a fair amount of ethnic food so we're used to lots of flavor & a lot of meatball/meatloaf rec...
4/8/2010,5,Very good!  I slightly overcooked my meatballs though. I would take them out closer to 18-20 minutes and definitely not 25. I also used ground turkey and doubled the spices to counteract the bl...
4/7/2010,5,By far the best I have made...but I used ground turkey instead of hamburger. Was a pleaser for all including picky kids! I will definitely make again! Thanks for the recipe!
4/7/2010,5,Thanks you have found the perfect meatball recipe.  Made is with Best Marinara Sauce (on this site) - perfect.  Have used in sandwiches and tried both with spaghetti.  Freeze great.
4/6/2010,5,I made these yesterday and the only change was that I also used some ground pork in addition to the ground beef.  Once cooked I refrigerated them.  Today I placed them in a crock pot with 2 ja...
4/6/2010,5,Excellent I used ground turkey instead and it was a big family hit.  Thanks
4/6/2010,5,Really good!! I added Shred. Ched. Cheese Parm. Cheese & Grated Parm. Cheese (didn't mearsure)...Top each M-B with sauce (your choice I like Prego) B-4 baking. Will make again!!
4/6/2010,5,fantastic! I used 1 pound ground turkey and the spice was enough to cover the texture issue you sometimes get with ground turkey.  The whole family love them.
4/6/2010,5,I made these meatballs last night and followed the recipe exactly as written...they turned out FABULOUS! I also had some french rolls that I scooped some of the contents out of and put 3 meatbal...
4/6/2010,5,This definetly earned 5 stars.  I put these in spaghetti and instead of doing 1 lbs. I did 1.5 because 4 servings wouldn't be enough.  This was so so so easy to make I love it!!!!!!!
4/5/2010,5,I never thought about the Parm. cheese - thanks!!!
4/5/2010,5,MMmmm I used turkey meat & instead of Italian seasoning I used Pappy's Lemon Pepper & substituted seasoned bread crumbs for crushed saltine crackers..cooked & added them to a tortellini soup!Ver...
4/5/2010,5,Oh I this made this tonight for supper and this is a excellent dish I made a zucchini potato bake for a side and you have a great supper!
4/5/2010,5,These were delish. Will make again for sure.
4/5/2010,5,I've used this recipe before and I always add 1 or 2 eggs as a bonding agent.  The meatballs hold together perfectly and the egg is good additional protein for you.
4/5/2010,5,I made this recipe last week but used ground turkey.  The meatballs were the best I've ever eaten!!!
4/5/2010,5,This is a fantastic recipe and it's quick and easy.
4/5/2010,5,This is how I make my meatballs.
4/5/2010,5,This recipe is/was absolutely wonderful.
4/5/2010,5,This sounds great.  If I want the meatballs to use it with spaghetti how long would you think the meatballs should simmer in the sauce?
4/4/2010,5,I took a leap of faith and quadrupled this recipe and it was worth the risk! Sooo wonderful! I used ground sirloin. I was alittle worried about not using any egg but I followed the recipe to a ...
4/3/2010,5,DELISH !!!! - do not change a thing.
4/3/2010,5,Only one thing to say: Meatball Perfection.
3/31/2010,5,I love these!  They have a hearty beefy taste and texture and not the mushy/spongy taste that so many meatball recipes have.  I'm not one for measuring everything but I can't see how you can g...
3/31/2010,5,OMG...these are SCRUMPTIOUS!!!!  I was looking for something different to do with my ground beef and this was my winner!  EXCELLENT!  I used panko for the bread crumbs as that's all I ever buy a...
3/30/2010,5,Loved the recipe.  I made two batches.  The first one exactly like the recipe and the meatballs were very moist and flavorful.  The second batch I made for my kids and omitted the red pepper fla...
3/29/2010,5,I made these with turkey tonight and YUM! Easy and tastes great! I love that it doesn't use an egg. I used a pinch of cayenne in place of the hot sauce and was just the right amount of heat.
3/29/2010,5,I have tried numerous recipes to find my perfect meatball. I can stop looking. These were very flavorful and moist. Next time I will mince the onions instead of just finely chopping them since m...
3/29/2010,5,I made these to go in spagetti I left out the parmesean cheese because I didn't have any and used only 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes and left out the red hot. They were perfect.
3/29/2010,5,So freaking good!  We had them as sandwiches on a large Italian bread that I cut lengthwise and spread garlic butter on and then toasted. Topped it with some mozzarella cheese and it was awesome...
3/28/2010,5,this makes great turkey meatballs. i only used about a 1/4 tsp of salt b/c 1/2 tsp seemed to much. the hint of pepper in these really set them off.
3/28/2010,5,These were fantastic!  Just the right amount of kick. The only change we made was to use 3 cloves garlic minced instead of garlic salt.
3/27/2010,5,I pulled up this recipe for my boyfriend when he asked me How do I make meatballs?  Based on the good reviews I knew this recipe probably wouldn't fail him.  I was right!  He loved these meat...

3/26/2010,5,My kids was served this with Nana's Pasta sauce by EAKE and my son said it was better then Subway's meatball sub. WOW is what I thought. 3 of my kids had 2 hot dog size meatball subs a piece. ...

3/24/2010,5,Killer good! I really loved the addition of the worcestershire sauce in these. I did reduce the amount of crushed pepper flakes due to the little guy but followed the recipe exactly otherwise. ...
3/23/2010,5,Best meatballs I have had in a long time. Very juicy and right amount of heat. My 2 year old loved them too! and she isn't a big meat fan.

3/10/2010,5,These are the best tasting meatballs we have ever eaten!!!  We followed the recipe as written and used a large cookie scoop to keep them equal shaped.  The kids loved to roll them into a ball.  ...
3/9/2010,5,The best meatballs we have made yet and we've been looking for a while! Very easy to make and quite flavorful. Thanks!

3/7/2010,5,Yum! Love the kick of the pepper flakes and hot sauce (I used Tabasco).  Only change was to maybe halve the Worcestershire - we like it but aren't wild about it.  Meatballs were delicious and m...

11/25/2011,5,I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it!  I cooked the onions first but followed the recipe for everything else.
11/25/2011,5,Prepared as written except I used the french fried onions for a topping instead of the crackers. Delicious!
11/25/2011,5,This was a nice change and is better than the soup version.  I did add a handful of bacon bits and slivered almond.  A half teaspoon of onion powder and garlic powder.  I used fried onions becau...

11/25/2011,5,So delicious..I added garlic powder and probably didn't even need to do that..a keeper!
11/24/2011,5,Excellent recipe! I will never make the mushroom soup version again. I did use the fried onion topping instead of the cracker topping.

- Sauteed the onion first before adding anything else
- Used fresh green beans (which probably doesn't matter much)
- mixed Fre..."

11/16/2011,5,The best green bean casserole ever!
11/15/2011,5,"LOVE IT! Even the kids can't get enough.

Substitutions: 1 cup fried onions with green beans; french fried onion instead of crackers with cheese."

10/27/2011,5,A++++ so yummy....my husband and I ate almost the whole casserole!  No joke!  Take the advice of others and cut the salt....those French fried onions are very salty!
10/24/2011,5,I used Fiber Selects in place of  buttery round crackers. Fantastic although I don't usually care for green beans. I will definatly make this again.

8/14/2011,5,This is fantastic. So much better than the traditional green bean casserole.
8/1/2011,5,So delicious. I added extra ritz topping. I also used about half the cheese just to lower saturated fat intake. My husband doesn't like that cream of mushroom soup stuff but he loves this!
7/23/2011,5,I cooked fresh green beans for this recipe and substituted chopped scallions for the onion since that is what I had on hand.  My whole family liked the dish but we were split 50-50 on whether w...

1/11/2008,5,A big hit. Loved the sour cream instead of cream of mushroom soup.
1/11/2008,5,I was looking for something to tweak the same-old green bean casserole recipe and this was it. No leftovers of this on Thanksgiving.

11/24/2007,5,I loved this casserole!  So rich and so creamy.  As I was making this I realized that I didn't have sour cream so I substituted cream cheese.  I think that made it a little extra rich.
11/24/2007,5,Will never make the mushroom soup version again!  This was fabulous! Along with the buttered crumbled crackers I mixed in crushed fried onions for the topping.  I mixed the cheese in with the be...

11/22/2007,5,I made almost exactly per the recipe.  I held all the onions in the mixture and topped with the traditional French's crunchy onions since many in my family can't tolerate onions but can pick off...
11/22/2007,5,So good. I used white cheddar cheese and mixed in some mushrooms. Even my father in law - not a green bean fan by any means - had a bite and gave it high marks.
11/22/2007,5,I took the following suggestions and it came out perfect. I used 1/2 Tsp. of salt and only 1 Tbsp of flour. I sauted the onions in butter before adding them. We used the whole 2 cups of cheese a...

10/31/2004,5,The best green bean casserole I have ever had!  Once you try this you will never go back to the plain condensed soup green bean casserole.  I always have lots of request for the recipe.
10/30/2004,5,Wow!! I used half squash and half beans (fresh nuked for 2 minutes each)  also half sour cream (light) and half a can of cream of mushroom soup and reduced the cheese to like half a cup (half...
10/25/2004,5,This was really good!  I didn't change a thing.  I thought it would be a little soupy with the sour cream but it was very thick and rich.  My family loved it even my picky father!
10/14/2004,5,Very Very Good. Be sure to use french style green beans. I didn't and wished I had. Tasted great anyway.

10/8/2004,5,I am not a fan of normal greenbean casserole - even if I was hungry I would not eat it. This on the other hand is SUPERB!!!  Every time I make it I get asked for the recipe!  I use the regular...

1/8/2004,5,Wonderful--Thank you Amy!
1/7/2004,5,My hubby loves the oringal cream of mushroom version but I hated it... Found this one decided to try it and it simply made this one a regular side dish that we look forward to devouring.
1/6/2004,5,This is the best green bean casserole I have ever tasted.  I make it all the time and get so many compliments.  However I do add extra cheese in the green bean mixture and more crackers on top....
1/5/2004,5,We liked this better then the typical recipe.  Again none left.

6/15/2003,5,Wow!  This was great.  I expected something like the traditional green bean casserole.  However this was far better.  I will never make the other one (with canned fried onion rings) again.
5/10/2003,5,I used light sour cream and light cheese and it turned out delicious. Also substituted canned french style beans with frozen.......worked great and the beans didn't get too soggy.
5/8/2003,5,This was a great change from the old green bean caserole.  I addded 1 pound of cooked bacon crumbled and then topped with Durkee Fried Onions omitting the cracker topping.  This was fantastic!

12/10/2002,5,I don't eat green beans but everyone else did at dinner and raved about this recipe so it must be a hit.
12/4/2002,5,I tried this recipe twice.  The first time I made it as printed.  The onions were crunchy and raw it was salty and the flour made it too thick.  I tried it again incorporating suggestions fro...

4/28/2000,5,I have made dozens of chocolate chip cookies using all sorts of different recipes - I like that these have the extra flavor that the pudding offers and they stay cakey instead of flat

1/18/2017,5,I made this recipe just as it was written and it was excellent! Great payoff for all the butternut squash labor. I topped it with cheddar and avocado and had to go back for seconds!
1/15/2017,5,I made this recipe with only one variation: using ground chuck instead of ground turkey; my wife and I don't feel that ground turkey is inherently healthier than ground beef. Other than that ...
1/10/2017,5,I eliminated the corn and increased the chicken broth o 1 cup.....this recipe was absolutely delicious!
1/5/2017,5,Delicious and healthy and if it wasn't for the squash it would have been done in a flash. Next time I'll buy frozen squash to solve that!

2/6/2015,5,Made it as is. Great low calorie dish that tastes great.
2/5/2015,5,It's a really good and simple recipe I make a double batch and freeze it for later use. I find shredding Gruyere Cheese over the final product when serving adds a great nutty flavor.
11/30/2014,5,I only changed a few things but this turned out seriously  amazing. Love the sweetness from the butternut squash. I don't think I can go back to normal chili after this. Changes I made were  se...

11/6/2010,5,Really enjoyed this!  I took the advice of several others and increased the garlic - I used 4 cloves. Instead of hominy I used chili beans because I had them on hand. I also increased the chicke...

10/11/2010,5,We're vegetarians so I beefed it up with black and garbanzo beans.   Substituted paste for sauce (per other users)...  loaded up the spices and WONDERFUL!  The squash gives the whole dish a b...
5/26/2010,5,Very pleased with this!  I could not find hominy in the store and as a result I had to put in plain corn niblets.  I will make this a regular recipe.
3/24/2010,5,AWESOME! We loved it. I was introducing my picky family to Butternut Squash. They ate it! I can't believe it! It was so delicious this is now added to my recipe box! Yay!

1/31/2010,5,Delicious and so good for you! I added 2 diced red bell pepperslots of extra seasoning (I like it spicy :) and an extra can of tomatoes (stewed). I was unsure about the hominy but it was pheno...

11/19/2009,5,This chili is amazing! I used my crock pot and cooked the chili for about 8 hrs on high. The only change I made was to cut the squash smaller to cook faster. This is a new favorite at our house.
11/17/2009,5,This was so good!  I added black beans but did everything else as stated.  I will definitely make this again.  Yum!
11/12/2009,5,Really yum.  Great variation on the same old boring chili.  Warmed me up nicely on a cool night.
11/11/2009,5,This was better than I expected.  The squash went so well with the chili.  It added vitamins subtle flavor and texture.
11/10/2009,5,YUMMY!!!!! all my kids loved this!!  Chopped the butternut squash into small pieces so my kids wouldn't know it was in there used 1 cup of chicken broth instead of 1/2 c. and no tomatoes.  When...

11/7/2009,5,I roasted and put puree into the slow cooker added a cup of corn a can of mushrooms tomato soup instead of sauce white beans instead of hominy garlic powder instead of g. salt.  Mexican che...
11/7/2009,5,Easy healthy and hearty! Ignore where it says it serves 12 though.  I think this along with some crusty bread or some sweet cornbread would have served 4 perfectly.
11/5/2009,5,Wonderful!  Everyone loved it - picky eaters and hearty eaters alike!
11/4/2009,5,This was great chili.  I'm not a huge chili fan and neither is my youngest son but this went over great.  The only thing I did different was add 2 cups of water instead of the 1/2 cup (totally ...
11/3/2009,5,My husband was skeptical but he enjoyed it and ate two bowls!  I don't know my squashes and bought acorn squash instead of butternut.  One lb was half an acorn squash.  I chopped it a little sm...

11/2/2009,5,fantastic
11/1/2009,5,I really liked this recipe. It has a lot of depth and the surprising sweetness of bites of the squash are wonderful. My modifications were small- I added a handful each of frozen corn and spinac...
11/1/2009,5,Delicious recipe. I thought it was very flavorful and mild enough for my children to enjoy.  I did simmer higher and for longer than the recipe called for because it was a bit soupy and I like ...
11/1/2009,5,This recipe is a winner as it is.  All the original recipe was followed to the letter.  In addition however I added two (2) medium ORANGE tomatoes medium dice 12 oz. of CUBED turkey chunks (...

10/31/2009,5,I was very hesitant to add squash to chili but i went for it (Acorn instead of Butternut).  I forked the outside of the squash and baked for 15 mins at 400F before peeling and adding to pot.  I...
10/31/2009,5,ive had turkey chili many times and butternut squash on the side but both combined is the most tastiest meal and its warming on those cold days. cheap to make and the whole family loves it.
10/30/2009,5,This was really great I used 2 Jalapenos instead of green chillies because I like them used tomato paste and the extra chicken broth.  Steamed the butternut by cutting in half laying in a 9X13...
10/30/2009,5,I usually don't like to substitute turkey for ground beef but I really liked this!  The only changes I made were based on some of the reviews I read.  I added 1 can of tomato paste instead of th...
10/18/2009,5,Used Great Northern beans instead of hominy and also chopped up a bunch of bell peppers that needed to be used up and included those. Delicious seasonal meal!
10/9/2009,5,Excellent. The only changes I made were to use corn instead of hominy just because that's what I had on hand and I added some oregano. Great flavor we really enjoyed it. Thank you! :)
9/20/2009,5,Easy to make and really good.  This recipe lends it self to many subsitutions depending on what you have at home.  I made a big pot and will take to work for lunch next week.
9/10/2009,5,Very good chili and pretty healthy too.  I happened to have most of the ingredients on hand so that was nice.  I omitted hominy but added some corn I cut off the cob.  YUMMY.  Will make again!

6/13/2009,5,Wonderful hearty chili recipe!  Perfect for using up my leftover butternut squash--thanks for sharing!
4/4/2009,5,Excellent recipe - I agree with other reviewers that the chili could use more spice so I added a bit more chili powder and garlic and extra tomato sauce and served it topped with a mild green ...
2/16/2009,5,I made this once and followed the recipe almost exactly. The only annoying part was peeling the butternut squash. I was pretty slow at it. The chili turned out fantastic though.
2/4/2009,5,This chili is basically a miracle thank you for posting the recipe!  Delicious incredibly healthy and fast.  Easily vegetarian and easily modified for different tastes.  This is now one of my...
1/20/2009,5,Amen! This was great and quick. I had to break down squash and hominy and cook it a little longer than the recipe but when it mixed together it was just special. Nice job! Cooking is all about t...

11/19/2008,5,This was a really good chili. I did make a few changes but not too many. I left out the hominy (b/c I am not a fan) and I exchanged the kidney beans for black beans. For peppers I used fresh A...
11/3/2008,5,This was awesome!  I forgot the chilis and omitted the hominy because I didn't have it but it was still amazing.  Next time I will try the hominy and serve the chilis as a garnish.  Can't wait!
10/28/2008,5,This is a great autumn chili!  Like most chilis I think it gets better the next day.  The squash was a new and exciting addition to chili and is very welcome.  I added a dash of salt and pepper...
10/22/2008,5,Great chili!  I used the green chilies as a garnish instead of cooking them in the chili.  I just used the squash I had and cooked up a pound of dry beans.  Easy to make!
10/21/2008,5,I was amazed at how well this turned out.  this is a great autumn chili!  I made a few changes based on what I had around.  Instead of chilies I just added one serrano pepper and cayenne peppe...
10/28/2017,4,will make again. Nice flavor. had to substitute white corn for hominy as i couldn't find it anywhere.

10/15/2017,4,Delicious. I used Rotel for the tomatoes and jalapeños  together. Swapped one can of those for an extra can of beans and d oubled the tomatoe sauce.
10/10/2017,4,This turned out really well. I saw the suggestion of one cup of broth and went with that as well as a little all spice. When I cook with ground turkey I almost always use cayenne pepper so abou...
2/13/2017,4,After browning in the pan put this in the slow cooker for 10 hours--delicious.  Family raved about it.  After about 8 cooking hours I mashed the squash into the mixer leaving it chunky but th...
1/16/2017,4,I omitted the garlic salt and hominy used minced garlic in oil and added a tbsp of coriander. It came out awesome.
1/8/2017,4,This is pretty good as is definitely chop the butternut squash smaller.  Bring this recipe UP to FIVE STARS by adding a couple of canned chipotle peppers in adobo sauce. You only need two or th...
10/16/2016,4,Next time I will not use the tomatoe sauce and add jalapeño for spice

4/9/2016,4,Pretty easy to make!! I followed the advice from other reviews and precooked the squash in the microwave.  I had to substitute frozen veggies for the beans as I found out that I didn't have any ...
3/14/2016,4,This wasn't perfect but it was really nice. I definitely recommend peeling the butternut squash. 110. It's also very nice  with ground beef (as opposed to ground turkey). Top it off with cilantr...
2/25/2016,4,Very hearty.  I enjoyed it but the husband and kids just thought it was okay.  If I make it again I will spice it up with chili powder and cumin.
2/14/2016,4,I followed some of the other reviews and used a can of tomato paste instead of tomato sauce a can of chili-ready tomatoes instead of 1 of the cans of petite diced tomatoes added a pinch of ore...
12/2/2015,4,Absolutely delish chili with slight modifications. I omitted the hominy as I didn't want the extra starch and calories.  Added 1Tbls crushed corriander  about 1t of cinnamon and some dashes of ...
11/19/2015,4,I wasn't' expecting this to taste as good as it did. I will be making this again often. I did add a jalepeno and some red pepper flakes because I like my food spicy.
10/25/2015,4,Just the simple chili recipe I was looking for. I only used half the cumin and used cans of Rotel tomatoes with green chilies. It came out pretty spicy but darn tasty!
10/21/2015,4,I made this exactly as printed. I would give it a 5 star but my friends did not think it was spicy enough for them. I really liked it.
10/17/2015,4,This is great chilli!  I added a few things (of course).  Black beans and butter beans.  And I amped up the chilies a little bit.  I'm taking it to a tailgater and I'm sure it will be gone.  I t...
10/8/2015,4,Pretty good...I have never cooked with butternut squash before so was a bit apprehensive.  Based on how hard it was I could tell squash was going to need to cook longer than recipe called for.  ...
10/1/2015,4,This recipe is great and can be tweeked in so many different ways depending on what you have on hand. I used tomato paste instead of tomato sauce extra chicken broth extra garlic added all sp...
1/20/2015,4,Yumm! To up the spice level I added smoked paprika cayenne pepper and roasted the butternut squash first. Then to balance that out served with some fresh squeezed lime.
1/2/2015,4,Quite tasty. Even my 8-yr old who does not like a lot said Yum! Also very straightforward to make.  The only changes I'd make are adding a bit more broth to make it soupier (1 c total) a bit...
11/10/2014,4,Used Navy and Cannelloni beans instead.  This is amazing and I have plenty of leftovers.  Very easy to prepare as well!!
6/29/2014,4,This was a nice twist on chili. I changed it just a bit omitting salt hominy and garlic salt. Added green peppers used only 1 can to
6/1/2014,4,Very Good. I made as written with the exception of the beans (I used black beans). I love that it is Healthy and taste delish!!
1/21/2014,4,Pretty gosh darned good.
11/17/2013,4,Very good chili but I did make a significant change substituted ground venison for the turkey.  Used home canned tomatoes tomato juice and tomato sauce. Corn instead of hominy. 1 beef bullion...
10/23/2013,4,I think next time I will do it in the crockpot I let it simmer for more than 30 minutes and the butternut squash was still too firm. Oh and I have no idea what white hominy is so we didnt use i...
10/2/2013,4,Great way to use our freshly harvested butternut squash. I served with sour cream. I could see adding  a cup of cooked small shell pasta to the mix to give it a bit more body. Nice Fall dish.
10/1/2013,4,I thought this chili was okay but I liked it more the next day once it thickened. I even added another can of diced tomatoes to it the next day. However what I didn't care for was the butternu...
4/7/2013,4,I make this chili about once a month.  I love it.  I don't add the beans or the hominy and just add a little celery salt to add the little bit more seasoning it needs.  It's a great recipe!
2/23/2013,4,Added a can of black beans in addition to the kidney beans.  More garlic doubled the chili powder and added 2 Tsp. chipotle powder.  Used a can of jalapenos instead of green chilis for more he...
3/27/2012,4,I softened the squash for 15 mins in the oven at 400 degrees before peeling.  I did agree that it needed to be cut into 1/2 pieces.  I did boil the squash seperately for 10 mins to ensure it go...
3/20/2012,4,I doubled everything except the squash chilies and diced tomatoes (I only had one can). I also used pinto beans instead of hominy.  I added some cilantro as well. It came out great - even my ki...
1/7/2012,4,Good didn't use the hominy just more white kidney beans which I rinsed and used more chicken broth to compensate.  As per another reviewer used tomato paste instead of the sauce.
1/3/2012,4,This is a pretty mild recipe so if you like heat you will need to add some cayenne or chipotle.  I roasted my diced squash in the oven and stirred them in at the last minute.  They added a real...
10/19/2011,4,Fantastic.  Have made this many times and it never lets me down.  Makes a lot but leftover are just as good too.  Freezable as well.  Substituted the hominy for a cup of frozen corn used only...
7/15/2011,4,Im giving this 4 stars only because I didnt feel that there were enough seasonings. So I looked up chili seasonings on here and added that for the seasonings. My family loved it...After the kids...
2/15/2011,4,Different.  I enjoyed it - my husband did not.  I followed the recipe just as is.  Next time I think I'll use more spices - it seemed just a tad bland.
2/6/2011,4,This was a great chili however because I do not care for ground turkey next time I will use ground chuck.  I took the other reviewers advice and added more chicken broth and oregano.  I also u...
1/19/2011,4,I really enjoyed this chili but made many changes based on previous reviewers. Here they are:  I precooked the butternut squash at 400 for about 15 minutes before adding it to the soup. 1 can of...
1/18/2011,4,Have made this using sweet potatoes instead of butternut squash with excellent results
11/14/2010,4,i added corn it was great
11/2/2010,4,Really enjoyed this recipe.  I thought the squash would be a little strange in a chili but I was pleasantly surprised.  My non-squash eating husband liked it too!  I used a can of white beans an...
10/10/2010,4,This is a great base recipe. I made changes some for personal tastes and some for health. I never use garlic salt so I omitted this. I used 1 1/2 cups broth and roasted the squash halves in the ...
4/13/2010,4,Good.  My biggest disappointment was that the squash wasn't more of a dominant taste.  We love butternut squash but could barely taste it in the chili - it tasted basically just like regular chi...
4/12/2010,4,fabulous and healthy.... I added a bit more turkey but otherwise it was great. There was a good spice balance.
2/25/2010,4,I tried my darndest to actually follow the recipe on this one but some substitutions ended up being necessary.  Nothing too detrimental I think:  I used yellow hominy instead of white (I've ne...
1/4/2010,4,This is surprisingly tasty. I was concerned about how it would turn out when I smelled the tomatoes in the pot with the turkey. The character of the smell changed entirely when I added allspice ...
11/22/2009,4,Really really good... great fall recipe. I added about 1/2 a tsp of allspice other than hat made as directed & served with cheddar jalapeno cornbread!
11/18/2009,4,Excellent and healthy recipe!  We added in lots of spice to bring out the flavor.
11/17/2009,4,Add brown sugar!!! This recipe was delicious with some tweaking.  After reading many other reviews I did increase chicken stock to 3/4 cup added tomato paste instead of sauce and also included...
11/13/2009,4,I made this with the addition of the allspice and using tomato paste instead of tomato sauce. I used black beans instead of kidney beans and omitted the hominy. I loved it! My husband was not at...
11/9/2009,4,This chili was very refreshing to have included the turkey and squash. I let it cook in the crock pot for a few hours instead of making it quickly on the stove. Either way it makes an amazing di...
11/5/2009,4,Good chili.  Different from the ordinary.  Like that I was able to use up some squash too!  Even my 17 month old liked it.
11/4/2009,4,This was a great recipe.  Easy to make and the ingredients aren't expensive!  I used frozen diced butternut squash and added some cilantro and shredded mexican blend cheese.  I will definitely m...
10/29/2009,4,I was wondering if anyone took a short cut and used a can of Hormel Turkey Chili and added it after cooking the squash and adding any other veggies.  Hormel Turkey Chili has a lot of flavor and ...
10/13/2009,4,This was yummy. The only changes I made were to add in some shredded zucchini to bulk it up and to use black beans. I may have also added mor broth.. didn't measure that.  This was a very mild c...
7/5/2009,4,I was looking for a recipe to use my left over Butternut Squash (already made/store bought) soup from a month ago.  I did not add the tomato sauces as per people's suggestion and added extra oni...
11/12/2008,4,Very good - I used black beans instead of kidney omitted the hominy and added some more spice and it was a tasty autumn treat!
10/12/2008,4,I like the idea of this chili but think the seasoning needs a little adjusting. I added a couple of bay leaves and some oregano and if I make this again I would cut back on the cumin probably ...
4/21/2008,4,This recipe has great flavor.  I used black beans instead of kidney (because I didn't have them). I skipped the hominy as well. It didn't thicken up like I would expect a chili to do but I'm no...
2/15/2017,3,I made this recipe because I had a butternut squash to use and wanted to try a different way to fix it.  Although I cut the squash in far smaller pieces than 1 they took at least an hour to so...
10/14/2015,3,I like my chili spicy- lots of kick. I made this exactly as indicated with 1/2 tsp of allspice. Otherwise I made it the same. It wasn't flavorful enough for me. But then I said 'NEED TO GET TH...
9/28/2014,3,I added 1 1/2 TBS of All Spice and 1 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. I followed the other person's suggestion about throwing the squash in the oven and cutting the squash smaller. I wish I would have cooke...
4/6/2013,3,A good basic chili but you can't even taste the butternut squash.  Big waste of a delicious squash.  I would recommend just adding a second can of beans for filler.  You'll save a lot of time.
11/3/2011,3,This was just OK.  I was expecting more.  I don't think the butternut squash added anything special.  It didn't really add to the flavor or the texture.  If you left out the squash you wouldn't ...
10/18/2010,3,I prefer to use pumpkin. The butternut squash was too sweet. I added corn instead of hominy and a can of tomato paste. I also up the chili powder to about 1/4 cup.
1/16/2009,3,This recipe has so many delicious ingredients however it needs tweaking for them to come together and each flavor not stand out too much from the others. Next time I make this and I do want to t...
11/17/2008,3,"I think I was too excited based on the reviews. I was good but not amazing.

I am not sure if my squash was ripe enough though- I have never cooked with squash"
11/21/2017,2,Squash too mushy
10/29/2009,2,This is a very mild chili not what I expected.  Followed the recipe pretty closely. My first taste was that hominy which I do like was overwhelming in this case.  Tweaked liberally: doubled t...
11/30/2017,5,"I've made these twice in a month's time...  absolutely DElicious!

10/24/2017,5,This turned out great!  I used tenders and also used melted Earth Balance spread to dip the raw chicken in. Baked on a rack for 20 minutes rotating halfway through cook time.  Then finished by ...
10/23/2017,5,I followed the recipe exactly and it was excellent
9/25/2017,5,I have made this recipe twice. The first time I followed suggestions from other reviewers and substituted the butter with milk. They turned out dry and tasted terrible! My toddler would not tou...
9/16/2017,5,My kids love these!
9/13/2017,5,No changes! Keep as is!
8/31/2017,5,I used boneless skinless chicken tenders. I LOVED this. The chicken was moist and had so much flavor. I used two pounds of chicken and still had a lot of breading left over so I'd probably red...
8/25/2017,5,Yep delicious! I took suggestion of baking on a cooling rack & turned out very crispy.  Next time I will use cooking spray first.  They did stick just a bit.  Saving this!
8/22/2017,5,A family favorite.  Quality differs according to quality of breadcrumbs and parmesan you use so keep that in mind. The technique is great. Turns out crispy and so much easier than battering with...
8/17/2017,5,Was to easy to make and delicious!
8/14/2017,5,Loved these. Took recommendations and used eggs instead of butter and baked in a wire rack. Need to remember to flip the nuggets 15 minutes in and broil for 5 minutes. So delish a nd not greasy.
8/12/2017,5,I made this for the first time and it turned out great.  Loved the flavor and the lightness of the breading.  I will definitely make this one again.
8/8/2017,5,I made in exactly as it says.. the whole family loved this and i have the pickiest daughter!  first time in a long time i didn't make dinner just to have her choose pizza rolls instead. only thi...
8/7/2017,5,This turned out AWESOME and was a big hit with my 5yr old. I didn't have any Italian bread crumbs on hand so I substituted the bread crumbs for some stove top turkey stuffing I had. I crushed it...
7/23/2017,5,This was easy enough for my 11-year-old son to make by himself an they loved it!
7/9/2017,5,These are so tasty. Just a little too salty. I will use less salt the next time maybe half or none? I will definitely make them again.
6/27/2017,5,the recipie was amazing! I would recommend using half as much salt because mine turned out   a little too salty
6/25/2017,5,Awsome were so tender; unlike previous homemade nuggets I have made that turned out super crispy. We all Loved it!
6/16/2017,5,This was simple and delicious I will definitely make this again

5/29/2017,5,I followed the recipe exactly and the flavor was great.  I wouldn't touch the flavors but may kick it up a notch by adding a touch of the Chipotle bread crumbs too.  However crispy on the botto...
5/26/2017,5,awesome
5/23/2017,5,Yum yum. I also made it in strips - just as good and a bit faster. Great with plum sauce or mango chutney. I did find it too salty - the Parmesan already adds salt.
5/12/2017,5,Tried many recipe and this one is Really good and I love it!!!!!!
5/4/2017,5,Fast and easy to make and fairly foolproof. I used italian seasoning blend instead of the individual spices and when I ran out of regular bread crumbs I used some panko for the last few nuggets....
4/13/2017,5,Made with olive oil instead of butter to coat the chicken (family member avoiding dairy). Added oregano to the spice mix instead of thyme. Panko bread crumbs. Flipped near the end of baking time...
3/19/2017,5,This was so good. Just finished eating it! I marinated the chicken in buttermilk and cayenne pepper for about 3hrs. Then coated with the breadcrumbs mix. Thanks for the easy to make recipe.
3/13/2017,5,We made these with chicken drumsticks and increased the cooking time to 40 minutes.  The whole family loved it (except for me because I am a vegetarian). Will definitely make it again!

2/26/2017,5,"Used pandora instead of breadcrumbs
But it was very good"
2/22/2017,5,These were yummy but I made some changes. The first change  I made to cut back on the sodium was using  plain panko bread crumbs  instead  of the seasoned regular bread crumbs. They were still d...
2/21/2017,5,Didn't use the seasoning they called for  I used my own blend. The best nuggets I've had so moist and tender and so much flavor. They didn't last long ..

9/14/2016,5,My family loves these nuggets.  I think that 1/2 cup butter is too much.  I think 1/4 cup is plenty to simply toss with the chicken.  We were out of bread crumbs so we mashed up one sleeve of Ri...
9/9/2016,5,Great recipe! My husband ate most of them. Kids and I didn't get too many. That's ok I can make more. The only thing I changed was the basil - I didn't have any so I had to omit. Subbed with pa...

7/24/2016,5,I used milk with vinegar. The coating changes I made were to finely grind up dry oats salt to taste minced dry onions and original salt free Mrs. Dash blend.
7/1/2016,5,Followed basic recipe closely but I did use a rack as another reviewer suggested. The nuggets did not brown using this method.  The grandkids enjoyed them (good flavor)  but next time  would ...

3/18/2016,5,1st time I made homemade chicken nuggets pretty good! I like using cheddar cheese instead and leaving out the salt.

1/22/2016,5,I substituted panko breadcrumbs instead of italian breadcrumbs.  I accidentally used salted butter instead of unsalted & these came out VERY salty.  My fault!  Next time if I use salted butter I...

I added some liquid smoke to the butter dip!"
4/14/2014,5,This was AWESOME!!! ...I have to admit that i was not sure WHY the directions say lightly butter the pan. So be aware to use little butter because the bread crumbs will absorb the butter and ...

1/10/2013,5,These were amazing. Followed recipe but I did take someones advice on placing them on a cooling rack on a sheet pan while baking. They were crispy and delicious!

12/8/2012,5,I truly enjoyed the baked chicken nuggets. The flavors were good and robust. I will adjust the salt flavors based upon my dietary needs.
11/27/2012,5,My mom has made this recipe for years and now that I'm out on my own I decided to give it a go myself. They came out just as good as my mom's and my boyfriend absolutely loved them! I took the a...

11/15/2012,5,just made it last night I was going to get a bag of Tyson strips but didn't want to pay $9 for 26 oz. and Chicken Breast was $1.77/lb.  As others have said there is a lot of salt with the but...

10/13/2012,5,So yummy! And they keep/reheat well I expected them to be soggy the next day but they were still great.
9/24/2012,5,My kids and I loved these!  The only changes we made were I used two eggs beaten to coat chicken instead of butter and I didn't have any thyme on hand.  They were delicious!!
9/16/2012,5,I followed recipe exact except i drenched in egg instead of butter. It needs the butter to brown. Tasted fantastic especially dipped in ranch
9/5/2012,5,These were delicious exactly as written.  My super picky nieces even liked them.  Highly recommend as a healthier alternative to fast food chicken nuggets.
9/3/2012,5,My husband and sons aged 14 and 10 all agreed I should make these again. Very rare for that to happen!
7/31/2012,5,These are really good! The whole pan disappeared last night with my 11 year old eating a huge amount. I made this one once before so tried a faster way this time by melting the butter (only a fe...

7/6/2012,5,Excellent - my children ate every one and asked for more.  Some tasted a little saltier than others but I like salt.  If you do not like salt definitely reduce or omit. Very easy!

6/19/2012,5,used thighs next time cook longer too wet.
6/11/2012,5,We used Panko Italian bread crumbs and it turned out great.
6/5/2012,5,These are the best nuggets/tenders that I have made.  I think the butter really makes them flavorful.  I loved them and my 2 year old did too...and she's a tough audience.
6/4/2012,5,YUM!  Thanks for the recipe :)  These were great!
6/4/2012,5,this is my go too recipe for chicken nuggets. Seriously the 'breading' on them is scrumptious. I have made them for two families who i took care meals too and they loved them and asked for the ...

3/7/2012,5,I've been looking for a way to make chicken that my 3 yr old son would eat.  We have a winner!  I read many other reviews and decided to substitute the butter for 1c milk and 1tbsp vinegar and s...
3/5/2012,5,My son loves these!  I've made every other type of nugget and he keeps asking for these.  I prefer not to do the butter but when I replace it with anything else he won't eat them.

2/27/2012,5,I have nothing to say! PERFECT!

2/23/2012,5,Very good recipe my kids loved them!! Thanks for sharing!!
2/21/2012,5,Great Recipe!  Very tasty I like them along with my 2 year old.  Instead of coating with butter I use egg and it works just as well.  Freezes well and still juicy after a minute or so in the mi...

1/27/2012,5,OMG! These are soooo good. I used I can't believe it's not butter but will try as others suggested and coat the chicken in milk. Frozen nuggets don't even compare.
1/26/2012,5,These were very very good!! Like others i used egg instead of butter & added a little cayenne pepper to the bread crumb mixture.  They came out great.  Thanks for the recipe!!
1/25/2012,5,My husband and I LOVE these!  I've made them twice in two weeks.  We used 2 eggs and about 3-4 TB milk to dip them in instead of butter and it worked great with less fat.  We also tried them wit...

1/13/2012,5,Very tasty.  I've made it this way but there are a few variations I do that I think make it a little better.  If you like it a little spicy then marinate it in hot pepper sauce and eggs for a fe...
1/5/2012,5,As far as baking chicken nuggets goes these are top notch!  I used shredded Parmesan b/c it's all I had on hand but the fresh grated (the green can scares me!) is the best stuff to use.  There...

11/12/2011,5,I substituted EVOO (Olive Oil) for the butter.  I make bulk food like this for my 15 month old.  Found the recipe one hour ago and pulled the chicken breast strips from the oven 5 minds ago.  WO...

10/5/2011,5,Super easy and good! I'm not a big fan of the thyme and basil so I left them out and used eggs. This is great for a quick lunch or dinner.
9/30/2011,5,These were definitely the best breaded chickens I've ever made at home -- I'm sure it's the butter! I was making these as part of an Asian-stye menu so I left out the cheese and thyme but kept ...

3/8/2011,5,Delicious easy...I made it with butter the first time and with skim milk the second and I think either way is good so I'll be doing milk from now on just to cut back the fat.

9/15/2010,5,Love this recipe.  So simple.  Only substitution I make is margarine instead of butter.  Also the mix is enough for 4 chicken breasts instead of 3.

3/20/2009,5,YUM - I left the recipe out for my hubby to make while I was out and from what he said it was easy to make.  My 3-year-old liked them as well.  One change we made:  We used crushed oyster crac...

3/11/2009,5,I really liked this recipe because it was so simple and fast to make but it was nearly exactly the same as this Herb Baked chicken recipe I normally make. But I really enjoyed it.
3/10/2009,5,I followed this recipe exactly and they came out great.  The only thing I think I would do differently is use milk instead of butter to soak the chicken in. Will make again.
3/9/2009,5,Perfect nuggets for my one year old! I saved a baggie full to keep in the freezer for quick lunches. I thought they tasted great as well! I made a sauce of mayo dijon mustard and honey. mmm.

2/20/2009,5,I followed the recipe exactly.  These were delicious and a huge hit with my toddler and husband.  I turned them about 10 minutes through so they would be browned on both sides.

1/28/2009,5,Really great!  Instead of dipping it in butter I dipped it in a mixture of 2 eggs and a little milk.  I did as another suggested and turned it on broil for a few minutes to really crisp it up.
1/26/2009,5,Great dinner for those lazy nights

12/30/2005,5,These were very good and tender!  I didn't want to use all of that butter so I used two beaten eggs mixed with a splash of olive oil.  I was running short on Parm so I used half the amount.  Se...
11/29/2005,5,To reduced the fat I used egg white with a small amount of butter to coat rather than a 1/2 c. of butter. These turned out great!
11/15/2005,5,Wonderful!!! Just the right crunch and flavor bakes up really fast...Better than restaurant or frozen!
11/11/2005,5,We make these all the time (even without any kids!).  I dip the chicken pieces in milk instead of butter and it works just fine.  Also try spraying some Pam on the nuggets before baking them to ...
10/22/2005,5,These chicken nuggets are very good. I make a big batch of them to last for my 3-year old's lunches the whole week. He eats them alot and loves them too.
10/20/2005,5,Excellent! I drizzled melted butter over mine before baking and this helped to crisp them. I made mine chicken strips instead of nuggets.  Will definitely make again.
9/13/2005,5,Tasty! My parmesan cheese is a bit salty so I deleted the salt from this recipe. The kids really liked this. They decided to dip in ketchup instead of a more appropriate marinara sauce. Cooked i...
9/12/2005,5,Better than McDonald's any day! My daughter loves to help with the preparation and it's so easy to make! You can even use these ingredients to make with whole chicken breasts. Thank you for shar...
9/6/2005,5,These were really good dipped in BBQ sauce and served with Crispy Crown potatoes.
4/14/2005,5,This was definately a kid and adult pleaser!! These nuggets taste great and you don't have to feel guilty about them because they are baked. You can't go wrong.
3/9/2005,5,Wonderful!  This was so incredibly easy and my girls loved it.  The flavor was great for both children and adults (not too sweet or too savory).  I also loved it because it is incredibly adaptab...
2/21/2005,5,My small son and I really liked these.  They were even good cold left over!  I also used egg to dip them in rather than butter  The only problem I had was by the end my crumb coating was ver...
2/20/2005,5,These tasted great. Mine came out a little dry but I think I over cooked them. I really like the fact they are baked and much healthier than most other chicken nuggets.
1/25/2005,5,WOW!  What a simple fast yet GREAT recipe!  My boyfriend LOVED it.  After reading reviews I used Kosher salt and a little garlic powder.  I definitely will do it again for us and guests.
12/22/2004,5,This recipe is the best!! everytime I have family and friends over we make this recipe. After they try them they want the recipe. My kids think they are better then McDonald's. Thank you for sha...
11/18/2004,5,Wonderful recipe.  My son who doesn't like anything liked these.  Will definitely make again and again.
10/28/2004,5,it's been a chore to find a chicken nugget recipe that will comptete with the  ones my 6 year old prefers.  he calls these the chicken nuggets that are good for you and they have become a family...
7/22/2003,5,These are so easy to prepare and everyone likes them---adults as well as kids.  I didn't have any bread crumbs on hand when I made these so I crushed croutons instead.  Since they are already se...
7/16/2003,5,My kids (ages 4 and 3) loved these but my hubby liked them even better.  I didn't use the extra herbs only the italian bread crumbs and they were great.
7/14/2003,5,I needed something quick to make for dinner and this was a great hit! I didn't have any Italian crumbs on hand though. So instead I crushed up some Ritz crackers and they turned out so yummy! W...
5/8/2003,5,I like these better without the extra spices ... just the parmesian cheese and the italian bread crumbs ... they were absolutely delicious. Definite keeper.
4/14/2003,5,It's great! I love it. I had my little sister try it too and she is a very finicky eater. She also loved it! It is a great kid recipe.
3/28/2003,5,These were great! I used 1 1/2 lbs. chicken tenders cut in half. Used only 1/2 tsp.salt Since bread crumbs were seasoned I  reduced basil to 1/2 tsp. and also added 1/4 tsp. black pepper. Put ...
2/22/2003,5,These were delicious.  Tim and I liked them.  Don't make them without the parmesan.  I did and the kids did not like them.  Really good.
2/17/2003,5,Very versatile recipe. Made by dipping in egg and coated in italian bread crumbs mixed with fresh spices. Tasted great!
2/8/2003,5,These were yummy. Very flavorful.  A bit greasy but the taste makes up for it :) I also cut down on the amout of herbs and salt.  Next time I will try either an egg or milk instead of the butte...
11/16/2002,5,these were great!  Very tasty and crisp and much better than fried.  I used a beaten egg to get the batter to stick rather than melted butter for a lower fat content.
10/8/2002,5,Super fast and easy to make and the taste is WONDERFUL!!!! Our 1 yr old loved them alot along with garlic mashed potatoes. The spices combined wonderfully and had great flavor! This is a great r...
10/1/2002,5,I reviewed this one a few years back...still making these today.  Do what a reviewer below suggests and use panko crumbs plus bake on a rack.  I turn them 3/4 through for even browning.  I also ...
9/13/2002,5,What a great recipe! My whole family loved these nuggets. I did not have too much of the bread crumbs left but I did use half of the salt thyme and basil like some of the others suggested!
7/29/2002,5,My kids finally ate something! I reduced the salt basil and thyme to 1/2 tsp each becuz my kids like more bland food and offered ketchup ranch like one mom suggested and applesauce for dipping...
7/14/2002,5,Very delicious! Did not run out of bread crumb mixture. As a matter of fact I had to make a little more to finish out chicken strips! Next time I'm gonna have spaghetti sauce as a dip. My husb...
3/25/2002,5,This was an easy and excellent recipe. Will definitely keep this one (even my five year old stepdaughter liked it). Will try it next time without the butter (dipping it in milk) so that it is lo...
3/4/2002,5,Great recipe...My husband and I really loved the nuggets.
3/1/2002,5,Easy to whip up and they have a wonderful taste. I use less butter they still turn out great.
2/24/2002,5,Yum!!  The entire family loved this one!  I served it with Ranch dressing for dipping.  The only part I didn't like was how long it took me to get the nuggets breaded but I'll solve that next t...
1/14/2002,5,My husband and I had these for dinner last week and we both thought they were delicious! I made some without the parmesan cheese and some with and the ones with the cheese were better than the ...
1/8/2002,5,GREAT recipe!  My 7 and 6 year olds loved it...and even ate their peas for more nuggets.  All I heard at the table was chewing and mmm noises.  My son asked me to make this a lot! The hubby ...
12/1/2001,5,This beats McDonald's hands down!!  Now we can make our own - and the kids love it because they get to help!
11/2/2001,5,Great tasting recipe so much better than any chicken nuggets you could get at a restaraunt or out of any box.  I found that reducing the amount of butter they still taste just as good but cut ...
10/26/2001,5,So quick and easy- especially if you forgot to thaw something for dinner!  Can defrost chicken in the microwave cut up cook and serve.  These are so tasty and easy- not just for kids my husband ...
9/1/2001,5,I am 13 and I made this for my family as a main course and they loved it!!
8/13/2001,5,These were great.  I will definatley be making these again.
6/30/2001,5,Great! Kids liked the nuggets. Thanks!
4/10/2001,5,All four of my very picky kids loved this!
3/23/2001,5,"I thought these were a very quick dinner from start to table was only 30 minutes. My picky son actually tried these and ate two of them.

We will be making these nuggets again."
11/21/2000,5,These were excellent!  They were very easy and so delicious!
10/10/2000,5,My four year old daughter loved these chicken nuggets! I will be making these often.
9/27/2000,5,my two year old loves these and so does my husband. do not over cook!!!
8/30/2000,5,My teenagers really enjoy these and they like making them too
6/25/2000,5,I highly reccomend this recipe.
6/21/2000,5,Even my picky little sister loved them!!!!
3/7/2000,5,Even my pickiest eater loved these Chicken Nuggets.  Im sure they will be a regular on our table from now on.
6/30/2017,4,All in all a good recipe. Way too much thyme though! Half it unless you just love thyme.
5/6/2017,4,Tasty light coating that browned and became slightly crisp. I skipped the salt and they were fine that way. My kids loved them!
5/5/2017,4,"I did not use butter to cut down on fat...just sprayed with Pam.
Easy to make and very tasty!"
3/25/2017,4,The breading mixture and butter could be halved and you should always cook anything breaded on a wire rack to crisp the bottom.  Otherwise the recipe was good.
3/2/2017,4,Definatly turn these over after 15or20 min.  They will brown on both sides.  Panko works with bread crumbs so they won't be too salty and have better texture.
12/15/2016,4,Really good! I substituted dredging in milk for butter to save calories. Was fantastic and will definitely go in the rotation of family dinners. My children gobbled them up!
10/26/2016,4,They were pretty good not great. I couldn't help but keep thinking how killer they'd be if fried but I guess that's the point of this recipe.
9/6/2016,4,Big hit with the kids and parents too! It was so helpful to look in the comments and see the tips people had. I soaked the chicken in vinegar and milk instead of butter. It was tasty :)
6/30/2016,4,My family loved it. I would only add less salt.
3/2/2016,4,Delish! Used 1 tsp basil which was perfect. They were too salty for me so next time I'll halve that.
2/16/2016,4,I looked at this recipe and thought I am going to make it that way and another way and have a test.  Well one I used the bread crumbs and the other I used Panko and put it on a rack.  I used eve...
12/28/2015,4,These were very good but for my personal taste 1 T. of Basil was too much.  I would definitely make these again but I would cut the Basil to 1 t instead.  Mine didn't look like the photo when...
12/17/2015,4,"These nuggets came out better than I thought they would ! The kids loved them with some bbq sauce and the adults with some Buffalo sauce.
The only thing I have to say against  this recipe is tha..."
12/7/2015,4,I will make these again :-)  they were really good  but my husband thought they were not crispy enough.  for the second batch I put them on a cookie rack and they did seem a little more crispy b...
12/6/2015,4,Very easy and the kids like fed it.
11/5/2015,4,I used unseasoned breadcrumbs.  But its a pinch to salty.
10/7/2015,4,We loved this recipe - the chicken was super moist and the kids loved the breading.  Extra yummy with Sweet & Spicy Thai Sauce
8/13/2015,4,Used milk with vinegar instead of butter and used chicken tenderloins. Cooked at 450 for about 15 mins.
7/20/2015,4,GOOD Worth making again. Just not as crispy as I thought it would be.
6/10/2015,4,broil at end to brown up
6/3/2015,4,Very tasty but a bit too herby for our family
5/7/2015,4,I used the rack method and it was crispy.  Nice blend of flavors.  I cut my nuggets thinner to keep them juicier.  I served them with a roasted Brussel sprouts and Apple's recipe also on this si...
3/19/2015,4,So much more than just chicken nuggets.  Excellent!  I am calling them Herb Parmesan crusted chicken bits.  Kids and husband love them.  I plan to use them for appetizers at an upcoming dinn...
1/25/2015,4,Made a few adjustments  and wanted to share!  First of all I used parchment paper instead of a a greased cookie sheet they did crisp up but I did flip them after 10 min and then cooked other si...
1/19/2015,4,Very easy to throw together but it's lacking in the flavor department. Maybe some garlic would kick it up a notice. Also I'll try baking them on a wire rack next time to make them crispier.
1/18/2015,4,We all liked it. I would cut down the salt next time to half.
1/13/2015,4,I have to admit I was iffy on these but they were very good. Glad I tried them!
1/6/2015,4,Very Good
10/28/2014,4,The taste of these is good but I managed to improve it a little. Here in Finland we don't have Italian breadcrumbs so I make my own with spices. But I also toast breadcrumbs to make my own shake...
9/4/2014,4,Great stuff as a starting point but I am trying to reduce my wheat consumption so I did something a little different.  Here were my changes:  I used 1/2 cup fine ground oats (often called Scott...
9/4/2014,4,My family loved it but commented on there being too strong a cheese flavor.  Next time I will try using onny 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese but there will be a next time!
9/3/2014,4,Very good.  Served with Chef John's honey mustard sauce from this site.  I think next time I will substitute poultry seasoning for the thyme.  Found that flavor to be a bit off.  Also I soaked ...
8/12/2014,4,Four and a half stars.
7/14/2014,4,Not all that much flavor but when dipped in sauces like BBQ or honey mustard then it really doesn't matter.  I love serving real chicken nuggets to my family and they love them.
3/8/2014,4,My 3-year old grandson helped me make these!  We all enjoyed eating them too.
2/24/2014,4,I liked these a lot! I don't think it's necessary to cook for 20 minutes-more like 17 minutes. I didn't realize that I forgot to add the parmesan cheese and salt until AFTER they were all baked...
2/21/2014,4,Super easy I added a little paprika for color. Big hit in my house.
2/4/2014,4,These were good and I would make again.  They were easy to make and eaten by parents and kids alike.
1/28/2014,4,This recipe makes really tasty nuggets but I couldn't get it to be crispy on both sides.
1/8/2014,4,Kids liked it. One of them even said it was the best she has ever had.
1/6/2014,4,Love these!  I've made these a few times now tweaking the recipe with different flavors.   Great high protein snack to have on hand!
12/11/2013,4,"I tried this..
Turned out perfect..But I'd suggest if you use beaten egg for dipping the chicken into instead of butter since it wasnt much sticky"
11/26/2013,4,Jonathan and Joe really liked these.  I thought they needed to be crunchier.
11/25/2013,4,Followed the directions. Chicken is very tasty. I used a wire rack like someone suggested. Next time I'll roll the chicken in flour then egg wash before the crumbs so it sticks better.
11/24/2013,4,These were really good and best of all- EASY. Plus I had everything on-hand which is always a plus. Unfortunately the kids wouldn't touch them. I think this could be 5 stars if you reduced the...
11/24/2013,4,"So tender and easy and delicious!
Last time I made them I used parsley and oregano instead of thyme and basil."
11/21/2013,4,Made these tonight and they were really good and tasty. Even the picky eater kids liked them and the only nuggets they've ever had came from a fast food place. The only change I made was the bre...
10/26/2013,4,I used a few eggs instead of butter and no salt thyme or basil. There was enough seasoning in the Italian Breadcrumbs. Delicous.
10/18/2013,4,The kids love it and I do too.  It is a great alternative to frying.
10/8/2013,4,Really great recipe. My grand kids loved them. I cut back the salt to half.
7/23/2013,4,These were pretty good for healthier chicken nuggets.  The only changes I made were to use buttermilk for coating instead of butter (I was in a healthy mood) and I only used 1/2tsp of salt.  The...
7/12/2013,4,Loved it
6/25/2013,4,Made this recipe last night everyone liked it. I wish the bottom of the chicken would have been crispy put it on a cookie sheet but the bottom was not crispy. Maybe next time I'll turn the ch...
6/19/2013,4,Really good! Maybe a little too many spices for me so I would recommend getting rid of the thyme and basil and just stick with the Italian bread crumbs which already have spices in it. I added...
6/10/2013,4,Absolutely delicious and moist. I was pleasantly surprised. Would definitely make again
3/19/2013,4,Good recipe - easy to change if needed.  Definitely an easy weeknight dinner.  Thanks!
3/5/2013,4,Easy and my kiddo liked the too...all that matters!
2/28/2013,4,Thought the receipe was easy to make...the only thing I would do differently would be to cut down the amount of bread crumbs. There was no need for an entire cup. Otherwise I will definately ...
1/27/2013,4,I only had 2 tbsp of parm left so I just cheddar for the rest.  I would probably do less basil and more of thyme and italian seasoning.  Also used egg instead of butter and cooked them for an ex...
11/10/2012,4,Super salty when I made it. Trying it again next time without the salt.
10/23/2012,4,Yum! These were REALLY good! If you like Wendy's chicken nuggets you'll LOVE these (they are a spot on copycat IMHO). And if you follow Teresa's directions TO THE LETTER you'll be in for a r...
10/19/2012,4,Great recipe but you really need to use panko instead of bread crumbs...with that change AMAZING
10/18/2012,4,Great simple recipe!  So easy and they came out perfect.  A dipping sauce of some kind is definitely required.
10/2/2012,4,Very good and easy recipe. A quick meal for a busy parent.
9/22/2012,4,Tasty! Breading each individual nugget got boring pretty fast but work was not in vain with end results. I used crushed crackers in place of bread crumbs as I didn't have any on hand and repla...
9/15/2012,4,I cut the chicken into 1 inch chunks and soaked the chunks in milk for about 2 hours in the fridge. I also baked the nuggets on a cooling rack. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. My husba...
9/3/2012,4,I made this for my picky kids the other night and they loved it!  I did follow some of the other reviewers suggestions and used about half the amount of parmesan and Italian seasoning.  I did no...
8/20/2012,4,This recipe was a hit! My two sons ages 6 and 8 are pretty finicky eaters. They were ready for a second helping in the couple of minutes I spent consolidating used cookware and plating my own ...
8/15/2012,4,Pretty good....family ate it up....used Italian whole wheat crumbs and sprayed my chicken with an olive oil spray rather than dipping in the melted butter. Tasty non the less....bet would be bet...
8/11/2012,4,I have made these several times my kid love them.  Even their friends love them.  I do not add the salt and I used unsalted butter because the Parmesan cheese is already salty enough.  I also c...
7/9/2012,4,Good recipe with quick prep for a family dinner.  I omitted the basil because I was out and used plain bread crumbs.  I think next time I'm going to add another tsp salt because they were a litt...
6/21/2012,4,"Made these with thighs worked great.
Also I did the standard flour egg breadcrumbs not sure what's with all that butter.
Anyways kids devoured them so I'm happy!
Serve with honey musta..."
6/7/2012,4,I liked these a lot but I used ground chicken and no Italian flavoring.  I'm not a fan of Italian seasonings.  Other than that these are delicious!
6/4/2012,4,This recipe was really great. The only thing I would recommend would be no salt added because it was a little too salty. I also used egg instead of butter.
5/31/2012,4,Really good will definitely be making them again! I baked mine on a metal cooking rack so they would come out crispier.
5/22/2012,4,We love these in our house!  I've made them with both butter and a skim milk buttermilk substitute which both turned out great.  Now instead of buying processed chicken nuggets from the store ...
5/7/2012,4,These were very tasty. I used ranch salad dressing in place of butter. I also put them on a wire rack on a pan as others suggested and broiled for the last few minutes.
5/7/2012,4,Delicious! On other readers suggestions soaked the chicken in buttermilk while prepping the breading then baked on a rack on baking tray. Didn't have breadcrumbs so put 2 loaf ends in food pr...
4/25/2012,4,Good followed recipe exact. Made spicy honey mustard and bbq for dip
4/19/2012,4,These were pretty good. I did use an egg instead of butter and it worked just fine.
4/17/2012,4,Place chicken on a wire rack (like the kind you cool cookies on). This allows the bottom of the chicken crisp up as well. I use chicken tenders. I baked 15 minutes at 400 then broil for 5 minut...
3/31/2012,4,I cut this recipe in half and used two smallish chicken breasts. The breadcrumbs I used were homemade. I did need a touch more butter to coat my pieces. I baked these on a large shallow pan that...
3/11/2012,4,My oldest son loved these!  My younger (picky eater) son wouldn't even try one :-(  Hubby loved them.  I used panko crumbs instead of italian bread crumbs.  I added 1 tsp each of old bay garlic...
3/8/2012,4,Great recipe and idea! I did what a lot of the other reviewers suggested and used buttermilk or milk/vinegar to dip the chicken in first rather than butter. My family loves these! Sometimes I u...
2/27/2012,4,These were okay.  I followed a reviewer's tip and used buttermilk instead of butter.  Next time I think I'll try the butter.  Very crispy but the flavor was a little bland.  They were good dippe...
2/16/2012,4,Wow! My kids love them. My youngest daughter pouted when she saw the nuggets for lunch. She said that she doesn't eat nugget. I told her to just taste it first since I was the one who made them....
2/5/2012,4,Fantastic! I made these gluten-free by using crushed roasted rice chex instead of bread crumbs and it worked wonderfully. I used a few other substitutions and modifications: I cooked it on a wi...
2/5/2012,4,Very good! I cooked them on a metal rack and they turned out perfect. I was really surprised that my 2 yr old didn't like them. I'll have to try and make them again in a few weeks and see if he ...
2/2/2012,4,Everyone loved these!  I did not use butter or egg.  I just put the bread crumbs and spices in a gal. zip lock bag and shake. Sprayed the pan will PAM and after I added the coated chicken I spra...
1/15/2012,4,Tried this recipe for supper tonight and we both enjoyed it very much.  Will definitely have this again.
1/14/2012,4,Very good.  I dipped chicken in a beaten egg instead of the butter because I'm counting calories and they were still delicious.  Since I used italian breadcrumbs I think the extra dried spices ...
1/13/2012,4,Tasty and easy to fix.
1/6/2012,4,The family was very satisfied and they were the best ones I've ever made. We made them for dinner the next night too.
12/14/2011,4,These nuggets turned out well but lacked a little more taste.  I will make again.
11/19/2011,4,Nice and simple. Like one of the other reviewers i dipped the chicken in milk rather than butter to lower the calories. Also i skipped the thyme and basil because my kid is a picky eater. he l...
11/12/2011,4,Kids loved these!
11/4/2011,4,These were good but a little bit dry.
10/5/2011,4,These were very good.  I omitted the salt because typically there is already salt in seasoned bread crumbs and 1 tsp is a lot!  Paired these with Sweet & Sour Jam.
9/24/2011,4,These turned out great! I used a pound of tenders and eggs instead of butter (ups the protein and decreases calories). But I have to warn you that this makes WAY too much coating. I could have ...
9/23/2011,4,We really liked this recipe.   I just wanted to add a few notes.    I did find the breading made more than we needed but I used 3 portion sized chicken breasts.   I could have easily used 5 chi...

8/25/2011,4,These are definitely good but I was expecting more.  I placed the nuggets on a rack on a cookie sheet (as other suggested) but the crumbs fell off and burned in the over causing quite a smell....
8/14/2011,4,Followed the recipe and it was yummy! With some ketchup I felt like I was eating chicken nuggets but much healthier!
8/13/2011,4,it was good...i think it would be better with out the spices....scotty's sauce was delish with it
8/12/2011,4,These are very good chicken nuggets!  I dipped them in an egg before putting them in the bread crumb mix.  I think the bread crumb mix could be reduced by a third...I had a lot of bread crumb mi...
7/19/2011,4,Pretty good a little bland. I will play around with it though. Thanks
7/15/2011,4,We really liked these. I did decide to use beaten egg instead of butter. One egg was just enough to coat all the chicken. I think I could have halved the breadcrumb mix as I had a lot left when...
4/26/2011,4,Really good and overall really easy.  Probably should have used a meat thermometer to make sure not overcooked.  Could use a little more flavor.

2/8/2011,4,These had a good taste but were on the soggy side.  I did broil the pieces on each side but I didn't do it too long because I didn't want them to dry out.  Next time I'll try using a rack place...

1/18/2011,4,The Parmesan cheese made these nuggets have such a nice flavor.  The family enjoyed these and I like how they are baked instead of fried.  Will definitely make these again.
1/16/2011,4,The grandson loves chicken nuggets and these have just the right amount of spice. Make a great meal for everyone or just a snack.
1/12/2011,4,Yum Yum Yum!!!  The thyme was a little strong not overpowering but strong.  I think next time I will not put quite as much.  These were great and I felt somewhat healthy making my own chicken n...
1/9/2011,4,Very good. They were a hit with my family.
12/28/2010,4,Good recipe I used chicken breast tenders instead of cutting them into nuggets.  Served with buffalo wing sauce this is a real winner.
12/26/2010,4,Thought these were very good. Definitely better than any pre-made from the stores. A little dry. I used egg wash instead of butter so maybe that's why? After the 1st batch was done I brush-coa...
12/20/2010,4,Very good - so much better than the processed ones from the store.  My kids all enjoyed these for lunch today.
12/12/2010,4,What a great dinner! I used cornmeal instead of bread crumbs to make it GF. I also let my chicken marinade in buttermilk for an hour before cooking this made it tender. Baked on a cooling rack ...
12/7/2010,4,came out great I cut up and seasoned the chicken the night before and also added egg to the butter. used Italian bread crumbs and then added a little Parmesan cheese. i wish i had a rack to put...
11/17/2010,4,thanks for a quick and kid-friendly recipe! only change i made was to dip the chicken in egg whites instead of butter.  something about chicken in chunks rather than baked chicken breasts that i...
11/11/2010,4,I could not get the breading to crisp. I did 15 min at 400 and then broiled for 5 minutes and used a baking rack over a cookie pan...a few of the pieces got a bit crispy but the breading was so...
11/6/2010,4,I also did the egg and skim milk coating instead of butter before breading.  I used plain bread crumbs with parm cheese and cajun seasoning instead to give it more of a spice kick.
11/5/2010,4,Excellent!  Crispy and tender.  I used Italian seasoned Panko crumbs.  My 3 girls loved it!
10/4/2010,4,Great!  Next time I would try baking on the cooling racks for extra crispiness.
10/4/2010,4,These were a huge hit with my family! My 8 year old enjoyed making his own healthier nuggets.
10/3/2010,4,I liked this recipe go a little easy on the parmesan as its flavor is very pronounced in the original iteration of the recipe. Also use a butter alternative and cook on a rack as suggested els...
9/27/2010,4,My 7 year old son who never eats asks for more three times.
9/23/2010,4,I made these for my boyfriend and I he loves them I think they're good but not the best.  Nice flavor but a little crumbly.  Maybe it's something I'm doing wrong? But it seems a little shake ...
9/19/2010,4,Pretty good for a baked nugget. I would definitely make it again.
9/18/2010,4,The flavors were very good but the breadcrumb coating turned out a little bit soggy. I was missing the great cripsy texture that I love so much on chicken nuggets. Next time I will just fry them...
9/17/2010,4,Very tasty was enjoyed by the whole family.
9/15/2010,4,I used the measurements the recipe calls for except I was trying to make it lighter so I used milk instead of butter. I also followed the suggestions and baked them on a rack on top of a cooki...
9/1/2010,4,Very easy and yummy dish.  Great healthy food for the kids since the chicken isn't fried.  Didn't have a problem with the crust not sticking.  Putting on a wire rack over cookie sheet worked gre...
8/14/2010,4,These do taste a lot like the frozen kind but they were a nice change from fried chicken.  I halved the amount of Parmesan thyme and basil after reading other reviews.  I was glad I did becau...
7/27/2010,4,I cooked them exactly as the recipe instructed except I used other people's suggestions for cooking methods. I had three batches so I cooked each of the batches differently. The first batch I b...
7/2/2010,4,I was not a big fan but my kids liked them so I'm being generous with my 4 stars. I used the wire rack and put them under the broiler for the last few minutes but they still were not crispy at a...
6/27/2010,4,I didn't have enough cheese so maybe that was the problem but the seasonings just seemed too strong imo... Too much Italian flavor; hubby said all they needed was salt and pepper next time.
6/11/2010,4,My 11 year old begged me to make chicken nuggest and these were what I chose. He loved them. I thought they were ok.
6/11/2010,4,Not too bad
5/12/2010,4,My hubby loved these I thought they were just o.k. To be fair I made my own breadcrumbs + spices--I wonder if they would have been better with store-bought Italian breadcrumbs.
5/11/2010,4,Tasty as-is but I think I'd like to tweak the spices to my own preference next time. I tried the cooking on a rack over a cookie sheet method and thought it worked well. Cut the chicken in sizes...
4/24/2010,4,For about 2lbs of chicken a half-stick of butter was plenty.  To save time with the whole dipping procedure we just poured the melted butter over the chicken in a bowl and mixed it around.  Th...
4/19/2010,4,I used milk and vinegar as suggested instead of butter.  I also didn't add any seasonings because the breadcrumbs were seasoned.  I didn't cut mine into nuggets but used precut chicken strips. ...
3/21/2010,4,Wonderful recipe. Took some advise from the other reviews like using items to sub butter.
3/17/2010,4,Delicious. Very easy and very good. Great way to make a delish lower cal dish with all the flavor. Did not miss the deep fryer.
2/19/2010,4,Easy and great tasting!
2/9/2010,4,These are really good! I love the flavors1 Much better than the frozen kind! My ultra fussy daughter wouldn't eat them (nothing against the recipe- she wouldn't even try them) so I can't give ...
2/9/2010,4,These were easy to make and my family enjoyed them.  I wasn't a huge fan but that's just my personal preference.
2/5/2010,4,delicious and a family pleaser
1/31/2010,4,I had some turkey burgers to use up so I thawed those cut them into eighths dipped in egg substitute and baked on a pan that has holes in it to let them brown on both sides.  I'm sure the butt...
1/19/2010,4,Very tasty with the exception of being waaay too salty.  Cut the salt to 1/2 tsp and it should be better. Better yet use crushed ritz crackers and omit the salt completely.
1/16/2010,4,i'm a low-carber for life but this recipe sounded really good.  i used 1c of parmesan and left out the bread crumbs.  since i didn't have the seasoning from the bread crumbs i added 1T italian...
1/10/2010,4,Fantastic ! I made twice - first time I made as directed (hence the 4 stars);  Second time I tweaked by using a mix of panko italian bread crumbs and cheese.  Then dredged in flour egg wash (...
1/3/2010,4,Very good recipe have made it both dip in egg and butter most flavorfull dip in butter though. My fiance LOVES these and it is a regular recipe almost weekly lately
12/30/2009,4,What an easy recipe! I took the suggestions from other reviewers and used milk instead of melted butter and baked the nuggets on a cooling rack over a cookie sheet. I could probably have coated...
12/7/2009,4,Great!
12/5/2009,4,Great suggestion to bake on a wire rack!
10/27/2009,4,These were really yummy. My husband and three year old scarfed them down. I made them with mashed potatoes and green beans. Delish! I also used beaten egg rather than butter to coat the chicken....
9/23/2009,4,Very good nuggets!  My VERY picky 2 yr old loved them!  I did the breading using half bread crumbs and half panko.  They were very good.  I might do full out panko because I would have liked th...
9/10/2009,4,these were quick and easy and the kids liked them. much healthier and cheaper than eating out..thanks!
9/7/2009,4,This recipe is good! I would agree the Panko crumbs make it best and by adding garlic to the mixture makes it even better. Next time I will be trying buttermilk instead of butter to lower the fa...
7/28/2009,4,I loved these!! perfect for my kids too :)
7/25/2009,4,Last night I made frozen bagged popcorn chicken and thought I would try the homemade ones tonight the homemade ones were way better than the bagged ones but not as crispy. I had a lb of chiken ...
7/22/2009,4,Easy- very tender.  I used half the bread crumbs and put it on a rack to get crispy on all sides.
7/17/2009,4,these were ok. My kids ate them and they were a way better choice than McDonald's.
7/17/2009,4,My husband and I liked this recipe but my four year old son did not.
7/10/2009,4,These were very good but too salty for our taste. Next time I would either half the salt or omit it entirely. There is enough flavor that you don't even need salt. Also I double breaded the nu...
6/27/2009,4,Good easy dinner
5/31/2009,4,Pretty good.  Dipped the chicken in egg instead of butter.  Still tasted great.  Will definitly make again.
4/12/2009,4,These were pretty quick easy and tasty. I think the bread crumbs didn't stick too well with just the butter holding it to the chicken - next time I'll make an egg wash.
3/25/2009,4,Very yummy!!
3/6/2009,4,Easy to make and my daughter and her boyfriend seemed to like them. I think the cooking time is a little long and the amount of dried basil seems excessive. Thanks!
2/15/2009,4,Thi srecipe wss great right out of the oven but terrible warmed over.  Eat immediately.
2/2/2009,4,my kids like them but to me they didnt have enough flavor.
1/8/2009,4,These were pretty good! I used salt free margarine insted of butter. They were nice and quick and tasty and risped up well when I used my cooling rack on a cookie sheet. I accidently put in too ...
1/7/2009,4,I made this for my son's birthday dinner and it was well received by both my children and a visiting friend.  Much healthier than the fried version and I like using chicken breast instead of pro...
11/24/2008,4,I picked this recipe because I'd been craving chicken nuggets but didn't want all the calories of store bought or frying. I did beat an egg and add in some olive oil as another reviewer did the...
10/24/2008,4,We'd definitely make again. They aren't as good as fried ones but they are a much healthier alternative.
10/17/2008,4,I wonder how to keep all the breading on nuggets? My nuggets were a bit naked. Made it for picky daughter had to make her to finish it. The rest of family liked it.
10/16/2008,4,I liked them a lot but the kids were less impressed. They like their nuggets very boring the bland frozen kind. I keep trying to make them homemade to get them to eat a little more nutritiousl...
10/15/2008,4,Good recipe but you need to follow suggestions to bake on a rack. Kids loved them!
10/15/2008,4,These were great... took a little longer in the oven than what was indicated but I think that has more to do with how big your nuggets are. I used egg instead of butter. Yum!
10/2/2008,4,Very good! I've added this one to my keepers. To reduce the fat contentI used 1/4 cup egg beaters instead of butter.
10/2/2008,4,These were relatively time consuming for chicken nuggets!  They needed more flavoring also.  Good but not 5 stars!
9/19/2008,4,Followed everything exactly except I put pressed garlic in butter. It was a great meal!
8/11/2008,4,I skipped the herbs because the kids don't like leaves in their food - and the flavor was great.My only complaint was that they were a bit dry. Overall pretty pleased and will make these again.
7/26/2008,4,This was really good. Nice to find a recipe that could please my boyfriend and my 2 1/2 year old son.
6/10/2008,4,It was a pretty good recipe with the grated parmesan crumbles.  Too bad my daughter still didn't want to eat too much of it. Used margarine instead of butter. Chicken thigh instead of breast. Ga...
5/23/2008,4,I thought these had a good flavor but my fiance just raved and raved!
5/13/2008,4,These were good but not a favorite for chicken nuggets.  I used whole wheat bread crumbs and used egg instead of butter.  VERY salty!  The flavor didn't really work for us as nuggets but I'm g...
4/29/2008,4,These are good even my picky husband said he would eat them again.  The only change I made was to use 2 whole eggs instead of butter to coat the chicken.  I did not use a wire rack like many re...
4/23/2008,4,Just okay the kids weren't too impressed.
4/17/2008,4,Only Four Stars on this one.  These were great 1.5 inch peices make the perfect size nugget.  I will however challenge the butter issue.  I am not one of those health nuts who care about fat co...
4/6/2008,4,This was a great recipe the chicken was so tasty and moist!  We finished all of them as soon as they came out of the oven.  The ones we ate last were a little bit soggy but next time I'll cook...
3/19/2008,4,I used half the salt thyme and basil recommended and added a bit of garlic powder. Instead of the butter I used a couple of beaten eggs. These are so simple and so delicious! I usually serve t...
3/19/2008,4,Really good. I served with a honey dijon dipping sauce from this site. I'll make this again.
2/28/2008,4,Tender chicken and breading consistency thin and crisp.  Will try different seasoning than Italian next time around.
2/21/2008,4,The chicken in this recipe came out very good and tender.  I used the amount conversion for 4 servings and instead of 2/3 cup butter i used 2/3 cup 2% milk with 1 capful of vinegar per one of ...
2/20/2008,4,I really liked these. Brian thought they were pretty good but Jack did not like them.
2/15/2008,4,This recipe got great reviews when I made it for my sisters.  I dipped the chicken in egg instead of butter and used less cheese but the nuggets were still great.  I'll be making them again.
2/12/2008,4,Jeannine made this in Florida
2/12/2008,4,Good recipe. Instead of making chicken nuggets I used this recipe to make chicken tenders. The ingredients were able to coat 9 fairly large-sized tenderloins. Instead of using melted butter I ...
2/11/2008,4,Considering I used an egg wash vs the butter I probably am doing the original author a dis-service by rating it a 4 but maybe next time I'll sneak in a bit of butter for a few of the nuggets....
2/5/2008,4,These were so simple but good!  I used chicken tenders instead of cutting up a chicken breast.  I followed another reviewer's tip to cook on a metal rack over a baking sheet (I just used the rac...
2/3/2008,4,These were good. Definitely need a dipping sauce we used honey mustard. I could not get the parm cheese to stick to the chicken might be because I dipped in milk and not butter will make agai...
1/24/2008,4,Pretty good
1/24/2008,4,This recipe is really good.  I used panko bread crumbs instead of regular ones to add a little more crunch.  I also used 2 T. parsley instead of basil and thyme and had to use the whole box of p...
1/11/2008,4,This was tasty with sauce. Mine were a little on the dry side but this didn't stop us from eating them. This could have been due to cooking them a little too long although I did follow the rec...
12/17/2007,4,half the salt
12/10/2007,4,These were very good and so easy to make. They are delicious with honey mustard.
11/10/2007,4,The flavor was good but was not quite crispy enough.  I baked them on a broiler pan and broiled the last 5 minutes or so.
11/5/2007,4,Yum yum yum! I used about 1 1/2 cup of milk and 1 tsp of vinegar instead of butter and just regular bread crumbs instead of Italian. I also spiced it up with a little bit of dry bbq seasoning...
10/5/2007,4,The kids really like this recipe. I would definitely say stick them under the broiler for about five minutes at the end. We also used the egg instead of the butter. I like that it is lower in fa...
9/30/2007,4,We really enjoyed this recipe.  It is not rocket science but a good basic meal to throw together quickly which is why I pulled it up.  My kids ate but didn't love it there was too much seaso...
8/30/2007,4,Way easy and delicious better than the frozen ones (although probably not anymore healthy). Does not serve 6 but will definitely make again. Thanks!  **UPDATED*** I now dip them in buttermilk ...
7/5/2007,4,the chicken stayed very moist.  great crowd pleaser.
6/8/2007,4,Tried the recipe 'as is' and they were flavorful and tender but not crispy or brown. Plus they were swimming in oil. I had a ton of crumb mixture leftover even though I double coated them thi...
4/8/2007,4,Delicious!!
4/4/2007,4,Easy and tasty for a quick weeknight meal! I didn't change a thing and these were quite good.
1/24/2007,4,Great recipe!
1/24/2007,4,These were pretty goood nuggets.  You can't reheat them as left-overs though.  They're not quite the same.
1/15/2007,4,These were very good and very moist and flavorful.  I don't recommend using a dipping sauce with them because they just don't need it!
12/19/2006,4,Loved this recipe!  I did as previous posts mentioned and placed chicken on a rack a broiled for last 5 minutes.  Very flavorful recipe and will plan to make again soon.  We enjoyed with both ho...
11/19/2006,4,Very good.  The herbs were a bit overpowering.  I will make them again but tone down the Thyme.
11/8/2006,4,These have a good flavor.  I made some of the pieces too small and over-breaded them and they were still good.  We're going to try again and this time I know they'll be even better.  Thanks for ...
11/8/2006,4,Not bad my family liked it alot the only thing is that the bread crumbs didn't want to stick to the chicken after I baked the chicken. So they ended up as half-covered chicken nuggets. Oh well.
11/5/2006,4,This recipe is wonderful and simple an easy thing to make with ingredients I always have.  I baby-sit a 3-year-old and he had so much fun helping prep the chicken pieces and put them on the ba...
10/12/2006,4,Great Quick and easy recipe! Make it quicker and add a little zest by substituting the melted butter for real mayonnaise.
9/25/2006,4,Great flavor the only thing I changed was the butter..instead I used egg whites to dip the chicken in to try to make it a bit lower it fat. This did not seem to hurt the flavor at all. For a go...
8/24/2006,4,Huge hit!   I used plain bread crumbs and two teaspoons of basil.  Kids loved it.
8/20/2006,4,Pretty good recipe I thought it was a bit to herby. Try flipping it to try to get both sides crispy.
8/16/2006,4,My family and I liked it and plan on making it again.  But I think it was alittle too herby.  So I plan on cutting down some of the seasonings.
7/14/2006,4,I am horrible at cooking meat!  But... this came out absolutely perfect and juicy.  I used chicken breast tenders and egg wash instead of butter.  I will now use this method from now on and am a...
6/2/2006,4,These are great.  I thought the cheese was a nice touch.  Definitely would make these again:)
5/31/2006,4,Easy to make and goes well with some BBQ dipping sauce.  Gives kids the pleasure of having some chicken nuggets without worrying about the frying grease.
3/22/2006,4,Much much better than any other chicken nuggets ive eatten. Real chicken nuggets......mmmm.
3/20/2006,4,These turn out very tasty. Easy to make but a little oily so let thm sit on a towel a minute before serving.
1/27/2006,4,Pretty good.  After reading the other reviews I dipped the chicken in egg first instead of butter.  I skipped the spices and salt and added some ground pepper.  I drizzled melted butter over ea...
1/27/2006,4,These was a great breading recipe my only complaint is that is was too salty.  Because grated parmesan usually already has salt added next time I will leave the teaspoon of salt out.  Did not ...
1/10/2006,4,These were good and tender~ :)
1/2/2006,4,I made these for my boyfriend who loves chicken nuggets. At first he said they were too dry but tasted alot better the next day. I followed the recipe exactly. Next time I might use olive oil i...
12/12/2005,4,Easy and delicious!
10/23/2005,4,Very easy to make. A bit saltier than I'd prefer. I think I might cut back on the Parmesan next time. Very quick dinner/appetizer. Thanks!
9/5/2005,4,Very tasty and was a great recipe to let my 4 year old son help make.
2/12/2005,4,These tasted very good. My only complaint is that the breading was a little bit soggy.
6/27/2000,4,My 3 year old son gobbled the nuggets.  I had to tell him to slow down.  Very tender and flavorful.  Thanks for a great tasty and quick idea.  I will suggest this to my coworker Moms as well.
11/29/2017,5,These were as noted in the recipe title PERFECT!!  I have always cubed my potatoes and will never do so again.  These were creamy and delish!
11/27/2017,5,"For the first time in 20yrs I got applause from all generations at the Thanksgiving table for my mashed potatoes !!
Thank you Chef!"
11/27/2017,5,Have made it twice for Thanksgiving and turned out great!   5 lbs. of potatoes is great for about 12 to 16 people. We served 16 people and there was one small bite left over!  Of course there we...

11/19/2017,5,I'm not a huge mashed potatoes fan but my family is... this recipe got really good marks. Will make again for sure
11/17/2017,5,I used Yukon Gold diced into one inch cubes and used half & half instead of milk. Added a tsp of garlic powder and topped with some fresh snipped chives. Sublime!
11/16/2017,5,I make these mash potatoes every year for thanksgiving. You know it's that time of the year again so expect me to make this. :)

10/2/2017,5,Very good. I did follow another review and added 3 Tbsp of sour cream. I don't know if it made a difference or not. Next time I'll omit the sour cream and see.

9/25/2017,5,Very easy and even the picky ones loved it! I don't have the correct mashing implement but somehow I got by.
9/16/2017,5,Chef John you are A-MAZING!!! I have never made a bad recipe you have shared with us! Love your voice too! You can describe how to cook rocks and it would sound delicious. Thank you for sharing...
9/8/2017,5,"Amazing and delicious !! Literally the perfect mashed potatoes.
So easy to make. I followed the instruction exactly as instructed. Pure perfection."
8/24/2017,5,This is my go-to mashed potato recipe!
7/28/2017,5,Excellent.  The texture taste and appearance were near perfect.  I made it just as the recipe calls (except instead of whole milk I used half-and-half milk).  Absolutely amazing.  You need to ...
7/24/2017,5,Best mashed potatoes I ever made! Yum!!!
7/21/2017,5,I love mashed potatoes doctored up with garlic sour cream & other additions but there is nothing like the classic mashed potatoes that I grew up with.  What makes these stand out is the cook...
7/21/2017,5,Easy to make classic mashed potato recipe that is easy to customize to your own taste. I will say my potato masher that Chef John isn't fond of makes awesome mashed potatoes toolol
7/18/2017,5,PERFECT! I added extra salt as needed to suit our tastes. This is the proper way to make classic mashed potatoes...timeless~YUM YUM YUM!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)
6/25/2017,5,I followed the recipe and the potatoes were perfect!
6/25/2017,5,Excellent mashed potatoes.  We warmed the milk and butter together in the microwave before we added it to the potatoes because mashed potatoes get cold so quickly.    Great taste and texture.
6/21/2017,5,No changes.  I believe the secret  is in draining the potatoes and adding them back into the hot pot for 30 seconds to dry them out.
5/26/2017,5,yes its perfect
5/16/2017,5,Love these mashed potatoes.  I have always used russets for mashing but never knew to dry them in the pan.  This makes all the difference in consistency and taste.  Thanks Chef John!
5/12/2017,5,"It was a lifesaver. I was cooking for company and had encountered some problems but the potatoes came out perfect and Saved the Day.
You go chef john!"
5/6/2017,5,These definitely earned their name they are PERFECT. I didn't change a thing and I made the best mashed potatoes. Thank you Chef John! :-)
4/28/2017,5,Very good though still lumpy - need more practice.

12/6/2015,4,The potatoes were great.  I didn't think that they were amazing but they were easy.  I'd make these again.
6/15/2015,4,Good recipe. Mild in flavor so you can dress them up however you like. Will increase the recipe next time though. This didn't make that much.

10/8/2014,4,Add smoked gouda and a bit of garlic and you have 5 stars.
9/16/2014,4,I make this all the time but was unsure of how much butter and milk per potatoes.  Now I know and I don't have to wing it.

11/30/2013,4,Just needs some more seasoning.
3/9/2013,4,Good recipe.
3/6/2013,4,The potatos turn out good but next time I will try not to use too much milk.
2/15/2013,4,I made this recipe ...... Very tasty and very easy..... I used 2 percent  milk instead of whole milk..... Will make again......
1/23/2013,4,I never like mash potatoes I guess thanks to myGrandmother but my boys kept asking for them so I decided to try this recipe it was easy perfect mash potatoes Thanks and I will make mash potatoes...
1/6/2013,4,I used to quarter the potatoes...this really seemed to make a different in the light and fluffy texture of them.
8/22/2012,4,Awesome! but I love them more fluffier. The mashed potatoes was perfect
7/22/2012,4,"This is a great recipe that I use often but on special occasions I
use red potatoes and evaporated milk. This makes the taste distinctive and very yummy!"
12/12/2011,4,Great basic recipe!
9/12/2017,3,Saying to add things to taste does not a recipe make. Every already knows they can add more or less according to their wishes. Also I found the description of three large potatoes unhelpful...
10/9/2016,3,These were a little bland so the next time I made them I added some sour cream.  This makes for richer mashed potatos. If I am out of sour cream I use just cream just like my grandmother made th...
5/3/2016,3,Very bland.  I made them better by adding a bit of 1/2 & 1/2 additional sea salt lemon pepper and a spice blend called Spike.  I also decided (on my second try because I usually love Chef Jo...
11/9/2015,3,needs sour cream instead of milk (milk is bland) and a pinch of cayenne (just a pinch) to open your eyes.  And garnish with some chives.
9/11/2015,3,I only give it a three star because I followed the recipe exactly but didn't really work out as it was describe. The potato took way longer than 20 min to cook. And the amount of milk and butte...
3/8/2015,3,"The ingredients are simple and good 
the method is laborious. I suggest investing in a potato ricer.
Fast easy consistently perfect mashed potatoes!"
1/13/2015,3,I followed the recipe exactly and they were not fluffy and lump free. I ended up having to add more milk and butter than the recipe states.
11/27/2014,3,This recipe could be perfect if the measurement for the potatoes was given in a measurement that isn't subjective. your large may be medium or extra large to someone else which will change the ...
11/24/2014,3,Very bland I had to add a ton of salt and pepper which I don't usually do!
11/14/2013,3,If you add cream cheese to these mashed potatoes you will want to save them all for your self.  You might gain 50 lbs. but well worth it.
11/7/2013,3,Good could have benefited from some additional ingredients if you want the potatoes to be more flavorful.
1/25/2013,3,The potatoes texture came out great but they were a little bland. It felt as if they were missing something but couldn't figure out what! Other than the bland taste the potatoes came out great.
12/24/2012,3,These potatoes come out well (and the instructions make them very easy to make) but they are bland.  I learned the hard way that my family expects more to mashed potatoes.  If you like good ol...
11/25/2011,5,I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it!  I cooked the onions first but followed the recipe for everything else.
11/25/2011,5,Prepared as written except I used the french fried onions for a topping instead of the crackers. Delicious!
11/25/2011,5,This was a nice change and is better than the soup version.  I did add a handful of bacon bits and slivered almond.  A half teaspoon of onion powder and garlic powder.  I used fried onions becau...
11/25/2011,5,NEW FAMILY FAVORITE THANKS
11/25/2011,5,My family hates the traditional green bean casserole so on a whim i was googling for something to do with green beans and came accross this recipe i put in the crock pot and my family loved it! ...
11/25/2011,5,Made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit. The only thing is that I made it at home covered it and then drove for an hour and ten minutes. By the time we sat down to eat the topping wasn't c...
11/25/2011,5,So delicious..I added garlic powder and probably didn't even need to do that..a keeper!
11/24/2011,5,Excellent recipe! I will never make the mushroom soup version again. I did use the fried onion topping instead of the cracker topping.
11/24/2011,5,"This was really tasty. I pretty much stuck to the recipe except:

- Sauteed the onion first before adding anything else
- Used fresh green beans (which probably doesn't matter much)
- mixed Fre..."
11/24/2011,5,This dish was excellent. I had a hard time making green bean casserole without french onions however so I added about a cup to the casserole itself and also sprinkled some on top to brown fiv...
11/24/2011,5,Took a risk and made this for Thanksgiving today without doing a trail run first. Other than only using 3/4 cup of sour cream as others suggested  I followed the recipe to a T and it was OUTSTA...
11/24/2011,5,This was the hit for thanksgiving. Thanks
11/23/2011,5,This is our new green bean casserole! The only thing I changed was to use French fried onions instead of the crackers on top. I increased the recipe to make 15 servings but instead of adding mo...
11/23/2011,5,I've been using this green bean recipe for years with a couple minor changes.  I usually add a bit more sugar (about 2 tsp) and I use corn flakes and butter instead of the cracker topping.  Rega...
11/23/2011,5,This was awesome! I changed a few things though because everyone loves the french's onions at my house I did add them to the top. I also mixed the crackers into the dish and added bacon crumbles...
11/23/2011,5,This is a delicious alternative to the mushroom soup/fried onion version. After reading several reviews I sauteed the onions in butter until they were soft before adding the flour. I also think ...
11/22/2011,5,My husband loves the traditional Green Bean Casserole so was not happy that I was making this one but he LOVED this one so much more!  Soooo yummy!  I did still use the fried onions instead of t...
11/19/2011,5,I made this for a crowd of relatives vs the traditional campbells recipie.   I did add the french onions though.   It came out wonderful
11/17/2011,5,Made this for a family reunion and had lots of compliments and people asking for the recipe.  Way better than mushroom soup version.  Will be making for thanksgiving and Christmas!
11/17/2011,5,my family loves this alternative and have been requesting it for years now! the only change i make is to brown the butter for a bit of extra flavor. yum!
11/16/2011,5,The best green bean casserole ever!
11/15/2011,5,"LOVE IT! Even the kids can't get enough.

Substitutions: 1 cup fried onions with green beans; french fried onion instead of crackers with cheese."
11/13/2011,5,Great Recipe...I made this yesterday for my family...my dad could not stop saying OMG this is sooo good  I followed other reviewer's recommendations and cooked the onion a little before puttin...
11/8/2011,5,This was the first time I've made this and I love this recipe!!! I made it from leftover fried green beans from the night before so they had a little extra crunch to them which was nice. Delish ...
11/7/2011,5,I still come back to this casserole anytime I want green beans. It always gets compliments.
11/7/2011,5,I love this dish....its replaced the canned cream of mushroom version at our house for Thanksgiving. I am gf and so I replace the flour with brown rice flour or a gf blend and its very successfu...
11/1/2011,5,My husband loves this!
11/1/2011,5,This was a big hit at last year's Thanksgiving dinner.  Even the kids went back for seconds!!  :)
10/28/2011,5,Delicious fast and easy!  I make the regularly.  I mix half frozen beans and half canned.  Mmmm
10/27/2011,5,A++++ so yummy....my husband and I ate almost the whole casserole!  No joke!  Take the advice of others and cut the salt....those French fried onions are very salty!
10/24/2011,5,I used Fiber Selects in place of  buttery round crackers. Fantastic although I don't usually care for green beans. I will definatly make this again.
10/22/2011,5,I followed it to a T and its was FANTASTIC!!!!! Rich but simple. Perfect! Thanks!!!!
10/12/2011,5,Hubby really loved this!

9/6/2011,5,Better than any other green bean casserole ever! I could have eaten the whole entire thing without it ever touching the kitchen table!!!
8/24/2011,5,My dad requests me to make this every holiday season! I do use the french fried onions instead of the crackers but other then that I don't make any changes (Maybe a little less something here......
8/14/2011,5,This is fantastic. So much better than the traditional green bean casserole.
8/1/2011,5,So delicious. I added extra ritz topping. I also used about half the cheese just to lower saturated fat intake. My husband doesn't like that cream of mushroom soup stuff but he loves this!
7/23/2011,5,I cooked fresh green beans for this recipe and substituted chopped scallions for the onion since that is what I had on hand.  My whole family liked the dish but we were split 50-50 on whether w...
7/17/2011,5,Simple and quite tasty! Made it exactly as the instructions posted.

4/26/2011,5,This is an excellent green bean casserole.  I followed the recipe the way it is described here except I did not use crumbled crackers and it turned perfect.  My husband and I loved it.

3/22/2011,5,The only crackers I had in the cupboard was Triscuits. I coarsely crumbled them and mixed with the butter. It was really good... they stayed a little crunchy which was nice.

11/25/2010,5,The wife had her doubts she was all for the tradtiional can of mushroom soup style. After having this for Thanksgiving she gave a thumbs up.
11/25/2010,5,Simply Amazing! Easy to make... Just added 1/2 cup of half and half (creamer) to make it creamier.. Also added a 1/4 cup of silvered almonds for texture... Sprinkled freshley grated Romano and ...
11/25/2010,5,Delicious...followed directions except I sauteed the onions with the butter and reduced the cheese by at least half....next time I may omit cheese altogether.
11/25/2010,5,Great!  Has a real sour cream taste to it.  Very different from other green bean casserole recipes.  Very easy to make also!
11/25/2010,5,Really good recipe. I usually make Campbells but I was unfamiliar with the likings of the family I was cooking for. I decided on this one and I turned out great.
11/25/2010,5,My wife wondered why I couldn't just follow a regular green bean casserole recipe... and then she tasted my production of Grandma's Green Bean Casserole... and she TOTALLY HOOKED.  We both a...

11/23/2010,5,I thought this was very good and did not change anything about it minus just not putting in the onions. My mom made it a couple of years ago for the first time at Thanksgiving so after that I wo...
11/23/2010,5,Excellent recipe!  Like many folks I chose to saute my onions in the butter - something I do for all casserole recipes.    This is also good with a cracker/fried onion mixture.
11/22/2010,5,Very Good!
11/21/2010,5,I LOVED this recipe.  I usually don't like green bean casserole but I chose this to make for a food day at work.  Everyone loved it.  I took some suggestions of some other reviewers.  I sauted ...
11/21/2010,5,The only thing I didn't like about it was the cheese being layered on top of the casserole instead of mixed in with the casserole; some bites were pure chesse because of it. Next time I'll mix i...

11/14/2010,5,pretty dang good i say
11/14/2010,5,I am not a big green bean casserole fan but was asked to bring one for a potluck holiday supper.  So I looked around and found this one.  I am not a big fan of the cream of soup casseroles or ...

4/5/2010,5,The sour cream is so much better than the bland and watery cream of mushroom soup!  It's zesty but I think 3/4 cup is perfect- I can see how other reviewers suggested 1 cup was too much.  3/4 c...

11/23/2007,5,I was so excited when I read this recipe.  It seemed to be exactly what I was looking for.  I only used half the amount of cheese because after all that sour cream I wanted to at least be able ...
11/23/2007,5,Loved this recipe!  The only thing I'd change next time is to add the crackers right before serving.  I also didn't have the room in the oven so I put it in the crockpot on low for 2 hours.  It...
11/23/2007,5,We tried this for the first time this Thanksgiving.  We added french fried onions.  Delicious!  Much better than our usual green bean casserole.  We will definitely have this one again.
11/23/2007,5,Made this for Thanksgiving.  The person who never comments on food said these beans are pretty good.  In his world this means two thumbs up and make it again! :)
11/23/2007,5,Yummy!  I made this for Thanksgiving last night for about 20 people.  They all loved it.  Before I could even try it someone hollered from down the table Who made the green bean casserole?  It...
11/22/2007,5,I was requested to bring Green Bean Casserole to our friend's house for Thanksgiving. I prefer not to cook something that I actually don't like so I found this recipe to make instead. The only c...
11/22/2007,5,They're right this rocks!  It is easy and tasty.  I used French's Fried Onions to top it since that is what people expect with a green been casserole.  I WILL be making this one again. Updated...
11/22/2007,5,I just made this recipe for Thanksgiving.  As I was cooking the sauce the flour made it a little too thick and I ended up adding a little more sour cream to compensate. I added some crumbled ba...
11/22/2007,5,While cooking this:  the flavor was delicious.  But after I cooked it it lost its creaminess???  What'd I do wrong?  It had nice flavor but had chunks of white flavorily glob?  I finely shredd...
11/22/2007,5,Loved it!!! I don't like classic green bean casserole with the canned soup mixes & this tastes soo much better!!
11/22/2007,5,This was so good! It is much better than the mushroom soup version. The only thing I would change (or add) is mixing French Onions in with the crackers.
11/22/2007,5,So much better than the mushroom soup one. This is a keeper!
11/22/2007,5,I made almost exactly per the recipe.  I held all the onions in the mixture and topped with the traditional French's crunchy onions since many in my family can't tolerate onions but can pick off...
11/22/2007,5,So good. I used white cheddar cheese and mixed in some mushrooms. Even my father in law - not a green bean fan by any means - had a bite and gave it high marks.
11/22/2007,5,I took the following suggestions and it came out perfect. I used 1/2 Tsp. of salt and only 1 Tbsp of flour. I sauted the onions in butter before adding them. We used the whole 2 cups of cheese a...
11/22/2007,5,I doubled the recipe (with some variations) and fixed this for office parties.  Of all the side dishes this was the only one completely finished!  Variations--sauted the onions first halved th...

11/19/2007,5,"changed to 7 servings to test. Used about 1/2 cup chopped onion sauted in oil first.

8/17/2007,5,This is a staple in our house during the cooler months. I do increase the amount of green beans for a less saucy finished product and I like to grate the onion instead of dicing it. It provides ...

12/25/2004,5,We had this for Christmas dinner.  Everyone thought it was great.  Plan on making this again.  Thanks for a great recipe.
12/21/2004,5,This never goes to waste at our house.  I've substituted 'regular' greenbeans with great success and add a clove of garlic while sauting the onions.  YUM!
12/21/2004,5,Wow everyone loved them very easy to prepare. Thank you!
12/21/2004,5,People in my family who don't like green bean casserole made the traditional way LOVED this. My two-year-old son devoured the leftovers for lunch the day after Thanksgiving and kept asking for...

12/13/2004,5,Very easy to make and its excellent.

12/6/2004,5,Loved it and so did my relatives at Christmas!
12/5/2004,5,It's a good recipe. However it doesn't make anywhere near the advertised 10 servings. Doubled it fit perfectly into a 2.5 Qt. casserole dish - yielding perhaps 5 to 6 servings.
11/28/2004,5,Absolutely delicious.  I will be making this for holiday dinners from now on!

11/27/2004,5,A nice change from the usual mushroom/green bean casserole. I used frozen green beans instead of the canned beans. Frozen beans are a more appetizing looking green in the casserole.
11/27/2004,5,I made this on Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  I added garlic and only used half the recommended amount of sour cream.
11/27/2004,5,The best Green Bean Casserole I've ever tasted!  We added cheesy French Fried Onions for extra crunch. Fabulous!

11/26/2004,5,I thought I liked the old green bean casserole but this was a great new twist.  I used sweet onions and put a little more cheese.  Excellent!!!

10/31/2004,5,The best green bean casserole I have ever had!  Once you try this you will never go back to the plain condensed soup green bean casserole.  I always have lots of request for the recipe.
10/30/2004,5,Wow!! I used half squash and half beans (fresh nuked for 2 minutes each)  also half sour cream (light) and half a can of cream of mushroom soup and reduced the cheese to like half a cup (half...
10/25/2004,5,This was really good!  I didn't change a thing.  I thought it would be a little soupy with the sour cream but it was very thick and rich.  My family loved it even my picky father!

10/8/2004,5,I am not a fan of normal greenbean casserole - even if I was hungry I would not eat it. This on the other hand is SUPERB!!!  Every time I make it I get asked for the recipe!  I use the regular...

1/8/2004,5,Wonderful--Thank you Amy!
1/7/2004,5,My hubby loves the oringal cream of mushroom version but I hated it... Found this one decided to try it and it simply made this one a regular side dish that we look forward to devouring.
1/6/2004,5,This is the best green bean casserole I have ever tasted.  I make it all the time and get so many compliments.  However I do add extra cheese in the green bean mixture and more crackers on top....
1/5/2004,5,We liked this better then the typical recipe.  Again none left.

12/10/2002,5,I don't eat green beans but everyone else did at dinner and raved about this recipe so it must be a hit.
12/4/2002,5,I tried this recipe twice.  The first time I made it as printed.  The onions were crunchy and raw it was salty and the flour made it too thick.  I tried it again incorporating suggestions fro...

11/14/2002,5,this was wonderful!  i did a dry run before thanksgiving and used the recipe scaler to downsize to use about one can of beans.... i followed what others had said and put half the cheese in the b...

8/14/2002,5,This is a great tasting casserole!  I used cut green beans from the can because I didn't have any french style and it came out great.  I also put french onion crisps (the ones that normally go o...

12/31/2001,5,"My husband and daughter thought it was good - but not as good as traditional green bean casserole - I personally thought it was every bit as good as the traditional one.  Its a keeper
rray"
12/31/2001,5,excellent for holidays - even my husband who hates green beans had a big spoonful of this!

11/29/2001,5,A big hit with my family on Thanksgiving. They even forgave me for not bringing the old and popular greenbean casserole dish.  They even made me promise to bring this one next year!
11/27/2001,5,The sour cream made this so yummy!  I used french-fried onions instead of the crackers on top.  I also mixed in the cheddar cheese as has been suggested in some of the reviews.  My whole family ...

11/26/2001,5,I served this for the first time (without even trying the recipe first) this Thanksgiving. It was GREAT! It was the only dish that we didn't have any leftovers - everyone loved it.
11/26/2001,5,This was a big hit at Thanksgiving with everyone asking for seconds.  I think everyone was surprised that canned green beans could taste so good because they certainly did with this recipe.
11/23/2001,5,It was excellent but next time I would probably mix half the cheese into the beans and sprinkle the remaining half on the top as directed.  I also doubled the crackers that are sprinkled over t...
11/23/2001,5,I have never made (or had) green bean casserole before but I was asked to make one for my new boyfriend's 40 relatives this Thanksgiving. It was easy to make even with a GALLON of green beans!...

11/22/2001,5,I liked this recipe and enjoyed making it.  I'm not a great cook so the easiness was appreciated.  I did have to add some extra butter to my crackers though...they were pretty dry with the amo...

1 clove of garlic in with the crackers and butter --  YUMMY ! ! !"
5/6/2001,5,This was absolutley delicious.  The cheese made a crust on the top the first time I made it however so I mix the cheese in with the green beans.
1/6/2001,5,My entire family LOVED this casserole. Even my neice who is a very picky eater. She didn't want any one to eat it so she could have it all.
12/15/2000,5,I'm a Navy Wife living in Japan and teach American style cooking to three Japanese ladies and they loved this recipe.  It was fast and easy. A nice change from the mushroom soup type casseroles....
8/29/2007,5,This was very very good.  Thanks for the post.
8/29/2007,5,I served this at a party once and almost everyone asked me for the recipe!  It was a bit of a pain to make the cinnamon chips but they are SOOOO good.  A keeper for sure!
8/28/2007,5,"Love this recipe!  I've made it a few times for get togethers and I've received MANY compliments.  People always want to know the recipe.  

Super easy to make!"
8/27/2007,5,This was absolutely delicious!  Everyone was amazed at how great it tasted!  My only problem was that I used home-style tortillas.  They didn't get as crispy as I think they should have been.  I...
8/27/2007,5,Served it over a scoop of vanilla ice cream with the chips crumbled on top.  Big hit!
8/27/2007,5,This was FABULOUS.  I used seedless black raspberry jam and would stick to a lighter colored jam so that way you can see the fruit colors... but it was still wonderful!
8/25/2007,5,Absolutely delicious!  I used granny smith apples raspberries strawberries and blueberries with red raspberry preserves.  We ate it with Trader Joe's cinammon pita chips and it was terrific.  ...

8/23/2007,5,so good I didn't want to share
8/23/2007,5,This recipe went wonderfully!  I was pinched for time so served it with cinnamon grahams instead- still very popular.  Some folks used regualr tortilla chips for that satly/sugary combo. Only d...
8/23/2007,5,I used apricot preserves. So delicious! Be sure to bake the tortillas long enough so they are crisp enough to scoop up the fruit.
8/22/2007,5,This salsa is so flexible! You can use any combination of fruits (although those listed are fabulous) and you can definitely add some cool whip to this dessert. The cinnamon chips were easy to m...

8/16/2007,5,Had this at a friend's pool party and it was delicious and refreshing.  She served it with cinnamon sweet potato chips....it was awesome!  Now I can make it myself.  I can't wait.  :)
8/16/2007,5,This was a huge hit with some friends. We used Granny Smith apples for a tiny bit of tratness.  My husband made enough so I could put it over ice cream afterwards. It was great that way too!
8/16/2007,5,this is perfect - no changes necessary. i now use my mini-prep to chop the fruit.
8/15/2007,5,Delicious! We had it as a dessert which was perfect on a summer night! I only needed about 1/4 of the cinnamon sugar though. I've saved the rest for next time I make this ;)
8/15/2007,5,Great Recipe.  I plan to use those chips with other things!
8/14/2007,5,Please give this one a try - it has to be one of the easiest recipes to make and it is absolutely scrumptious!  Great for summer poolside get-togethers!

8/8/2007,5,Amazing!  This dish was the talk of the party I brought it too!  I doubled the recipe and it made sooooo much.  I don't think i'd recommend that.  I think this can serve more than 10 people.  Al...
8/8/2007,5,Instead of jam/preserves I used strawberry yogurt. Everyone loved it and its a great twist on traditonal chips and salsa.
8/7/2007,5,This was great!  Time saving tip:  put your cinnamon/sugar in a galon zip-lock bag. spray the tortilla's cut into chips and then put them in your cinnamon/sugar bag and shake.  They will evenly...
8/6/2007,5,This recipe is excellent and keeps in the fridge for awhile. It's also excellent on pancakes!
8/5/2007,5,I made this for a family birthday BBQ it was great I omitted Kiwi as I deplore them but added blueberries used a mixture of grape raspberry and blackberry jam really good and a nice addition.
8/1/2007,5,This recipe is FANTASTIC.  It is so worth all the chopping involved.  I will be making this recipe over and over.
8/1/2007,5,Wow! This is absolutely yummy! Even my 3 year old agrees.
8/1/2007,5,The chips are great. They remind me of how my mom would sprinkle cinnamon-sugar and bake the scrap pie crust pieces. Yum

7/22/2007,5,I made this for a party and it was an instant hit!  I didn't change a thing and everyone raved over it. This is a keeper.
7/22/2007,5,I was worried that the apple would turn brown if this was made in advance of the party but that is not a problem. The sugar and preserves coat the apple so it stays white and crisp. I added a t...
7/20/2007,5,Great recipe! I also added other fruits to the mixture.
7/19/2007,5,I wouldn't add all the sure at first. Try half and then taste it comes out rather sweet with all the sugar in the recipe. (I pureed for about a minute to take out some of the chunks.)
7/18/2007,5,AMAZING!
7/18/2007,5,I made this salsa for a family gathering a couple weeks ago and it was a HUGE hit.  Everyone loved it and it didn't last long.  We loved it so much I made more the next day and it went fast too.
7/18/2007,5,This recipe is definitely for a person with a sweet tooth.  I thought the presereves made it too sweet.  But overall this was a fun recipe to serve for guests.
7/17/2007,5,YUM!!  Loved it even more this time than last.  I used Gala apples which were delicious and I added them last to prevent browning.  For the preserves I used peach which was great.  Next time I...

7/14/2007,5,This fruit salsa won ooohs and aahs from guests.  Make sure to bake the tortillas enough or they will be chewy instead of crunchy.  The tortilla chips alone are an addictive healthy snack.
7/12/2007,5,As if this needed anymore reviews.  I used blueberrys blackberries reaspberries. the apples the kiwi and strawberries and used strawberry jam.  I did not use sugar and think it would have m...

7/11/2007,5,This is an awesome way to eat fruit. I used whole wheat tortillas to make it a bit more healthy. I didn't have any kiwi so I used two peaches instead and it tasted wonderful. Will make again! Th...
7/11/2007,5,I don't know who Annie is but this was a great Fruit Salsa and the Cinnamon Chips compliment the sweet of the salsa. Very impressive combination!
7/10/2007,5,This was absolutely fabulous-- people couldn't stop raving about both the salsa and the chips!!!  Thanks!
7/10/2007,5,Differnet and absolutely delicious.  You may want to reduce the sugar a bit.
7/9/2007,5,Excellent! This was a hit at the 4th of July picnic. I used the idea mentioned earlier about using an egg slicer to cut up the fruit. It definitely saves time.
7/7/2007,5,Excellent! I didn't add any sugar to the salsa and added some frozen blueberries. Everyone raved about it. Will definately make again.

7/2/2007,5,Took this to a 4th of July BBQ. Everyone loved it! The only thing I did different was I used spray butter instead of Pam and shook the tortilla wedges in a baggie with the cinnamon/sugar mixture.
7/2/2007,5,Incredible idea and very versatile.  The chips are perfect just the way they are and entertaining for the neighbors as they watched me make them outside to cut down the mess in my kitchen.  The...

7/1/2007,5,Made it just as written and it was perfect.  Will try other combinations based on what I have on hand but this will definitely go in the recipe book as a keeper especially for summer.
6/30/2007,5,Lovely!  I served in martini glasses with several triangle chips on the side of the glass.  A great ending to our Mexican meal.  Thanks!
6/29/2007,5,Mix and match the fruits as you need. My grade 10s loved this!
6/27/2007,5,A huge hit with everyone who tasted it.  Any combination of fruits should work.  A food chopper is almost a necessity.  I highly recommend this.

11/20/2011,5,Great recipe. Roasting seems to bring out the flavor of the sprouts. I added balsamic vinegar lowered the heat to 350 and cooked for 45 minutes.
11/19/2011,5,I cut half the batch and lef the other half whole... nice way to see what you like. I will most likely cut them all next time. This was really good and even better the next day warmed up!
11/16/2011,5,I make this frequently because even my kids enjoy their brussel sprouts. So easy that they can be made as a quick side dish on a busy work day. I serve them with just about everything!
11/11/2011,5,Like other reviewers have said like candy!  Such a nice basic change for brussels sprouts.  Added to our rotation of veggies.
11/9/2011,5,Delicious!
11/8/2011,5,Excellent as-is!  Wonderful!
11/8/2011,5,I absolutely adore this recipe but like most others I tweak it a bit.  Used about 1 T olive oil then another 2 T of melted butter added 1 T garlic powder 3 T white wine 2 T spicy brown mus...
11/6/2011,5,Excellent! My boyfriend and I hadn't ever eaten brussels sprouts but after trying this recipe we've decided its a keeper and we'll definitely be eating this on the regular! And at $5 a bag at ...
11/3/2011,5,"Absolutely delicious!

10/30/2011,5,Added a bread topping of parmesean and garlic to the bag.  It was very tasty!
10/27/2011,5,"This was pretty good although a few of the leaves actually tasted burned.
10-15-13:  This time although a few of the leaves were very dark none tasted burned."
10/27/2011,5,Fixed this for dinner tonight and it was awesome! The only thing I did different was I added garlic powder. Cooked 2 pounds and my hubby and I ate them all!

10/22/2011,5,Delicious & easy!  You made 2 new fans of brussel sprouts.
10/22/2011,5,I sprinkled some bacon on top and it was nice.  Gave it sort of a smokey depth that worked well with the Salt and buttery texture of the sprouts.
10/22/2011,5,Even my picky-about-vegetables husband really enjoyed these Roasted Brussels Sprouts. Will definitely be making these often! Thanks for sharing your wonderful recipe.
10/20/2011,5,We loved these!  Put them in the oven at 400 degrees for 20-25 minutes - until just tender inside.  Honestly I loved the outside shell pieces which fell off of the brussels sprouts - turned o...
10/19/2011,5,My husband hates brussel sprouts - refers to them as brussel brains - but loved this recipe. Even had seconds! This is definitely a keeper.
10/19/2011,5,Let them get (near) black - it carmalizes the skin so it is chewy and flavorful (not burned tasting) it is so good. I cook it more or less to the temp and time of the recipe letting some get r...

10/14/2011,5,I made this exactly as the recipe indicates (doesn't happen often!) and can NOT recommend enough.  So simple so healthy so delicious.  It reheats well and actually a cold one (or 7) as a snack...
10/11/2011,5,I am giving this 5 stars for potential and great bones! I was confused by some of the reviews which said they only needed 30 minutes in the oven at a high temperature. Mine were nowhere near b...

3/9/2011,5,"Mother knows Best! and these ARE the best! I used garlic-infused olive oil coarse ground sea salt and coarse black pepper. they are wonderful 
just as the recipe reads!"

3/3/2011,5,I've been making this for some time with a few changes. I cut the brussel sprouts in half and add a goodly amount of minced garlic.  I also cut the temp. to 350 degrees and cook for 15-20 min.
3/3/2011,5,I love roasted Brussels sprouts.  i use herbs de provence to season them.
3/3/2011,5,Excellent! These get almost carmelized and are delicious.
3/2/2011,5,I have made my sprouts like this for a while now.  The only thing I do differently is I slice mine in half so the cook faster.  And cook mine for 10 min. this flip and cook for a few more mins....
3/2/2011,5,did mine on the grill wrapped in foil.
3/1/2011,5,I have been making this recipe for years.. my hubby (who used to say he HATED Brussel Sprouts) and two sons love this as do I!  I also add a splash or two of Lemon Juice....  I can eat these up...

3/1/2011,5,threw on my fav no salt instead of kosher.  Even the picky twelve year old LOVED em.
3/1/2011,5,I have made these but when they are done I sprinkle some Balsamic vinegar on them.
3/1/2011,5,I agree with everyone!!!  These are absolutely wonderful.  The only way I will cook brussels sprouts from now on!  I do half them and cook them for only 30 minutes.  Delicioso.
2/27/2011,5,these are soooo good! I do not use as much salt just out of personal preference but other than that perfecto!
2/27/2011,5,These are absolutely delicious! 400 for 15-20 minutes and shake 'em around a bit (depending on preference-dark brown  and crunchy is best for us).  Oil just to coat and give some shine for crisp...

2/22/2011,5,Awesome! I just picked my first harvest of fresh brussel sprouts and didn't know what to do with them. This quick and easy method I was surprised how tasty it is. Thanks!
2/22/2011,5,Wonderful.  I LOVED it.  I followed the advice of others and did not cook it as long.  Just pay attention to it and when it looks done take it out.
2/20/2011,5,These are so good!  I had company over who didn't like brussel sprouts...they ended up having two helpings.  Definitely a keeper recipe.

2/13/2011,5,I think I may finally be able to tolerate brussels sprouts -- these were actually pretty good! The salt goes a long way towards cutting the bitterness.

2/4/2011,5,"not to knock the recipe but i agree with hotter faster method.  shaking the pan every 5-7 minutes is too meticulous for me.  400 - 425 degrees.  10-15 minutes.  

everyone agrees at the end of..."
2/4/2011,5,Really easy I don't think I roasted them for a full 45 mins though.  I put them over pasta with spinach GREAT and super simple meal!!

1/18/2011,5,Roasted brussel sprouts help me stay on my diet.  They are a great snack.  I tried using the Frozen ones and they worked out great.  Sometimes I add garlic powder and smoked paprika.
1/16/2011,5,These were delicious! Never liked brussel sprouts before but these were great! Baking is def. the way to go as it helps them to cook thoroughly in the middle and helps them to melt like butter.
1/15/2011,5,Best Brussels sprouts I've ever had. My non-sprout eating husband went back for seconds. Thanks for a great dish!
1/15/2011,5,awesome!  i added red pepper flakes and some garlic salt (although then they were too salty but all my fault).
1/13/2011,5,This was wonderful!  We have NEVER had Brussels Sprouts before and thought we should try it the pure way before adding other things to them. No need! These were delicious.  I followed other revi...
1/13/2011,5,Such a great taste.  Even my husband who typically does not eat brussels sprouts loved it!
1/13/2011,5,Never roasted brussels before....these are GREAT!  However I had my oven at 350 while a ham was warming and they turned out just fine and cooked just as fast....I fear they'd have burned at 400...
1/12/2011,5,these are awesome. i wouldn't change a thing. so much better than just boiling which is what I've done in the past but not a big hit with most people except me.
1/12/2011,5,This is great - sprouts do NOT taste bitter which is a problem with other recipes I've tried. It's fast and easy. Flavor reminds me a bit of kale chips. So good.
1/12/2011,5,Never been a big brussels sprouts fan but these are great and they ARE addictive!  I could eat them every couple of days. I usually cut the big ones in half and leave the smalls ones whole beca...
1/11/2011,5,I've made Brussels sprouts this way for a couple of years......best discovery ever!  Two things I do differently.  I cut them in half such that each half has some of the stem end.  This allows ...

1/5/2011,5,LOVED IT!!! I will not eat brussels sprouts but made this for our Christmas dinner as a surprise for my husband. I tried one just because of the other reviews on here (and they smelled so good...
1/4/2011,5,My husband could not chew fast enough! We will be talking about a completely different subject and he will say spontaneously When are you going to make those brussell sprouts again?.
1/3/2011,5,LOVE THESE!!!!  Only needed 20 mins.  Added garlic.
1/3/2011,5,Never made brussel sprouts before. This recipe along w/other user reviews was my intro.   Followed recipe but after trimming cut brussel sprouts in half and also added 1 teaspoon garlic powder a...

12/30/2010,5,Followed the recipe exact!  These were awesome will definately make again.  I ended up having some left over so I roasted them in the oven the next day.  So good.
12/29/2010,5,Fantastic.  May even be able to reduce olive oil to 2 Tb instead of 3 without impacting the flavor.

12/27/2010,5,I made one change to the recipe.  I quarter the sprouts (you could also half).  I still roast them for 30 minutes flipping 1/2 way through.  They brown nicely and turn out crispy and yummy.  My...
12/27/2010,5,excellent and sooooo easy.  i had the oven temp at 350 due to having other items in the oven but they turned out great.  you really do have to keep an eye on them to turn them.  they will burn q...

12/19/2010,5,Simple and delicious!
12/17/2010,5,I baked these at 350 degrees for an hour due to the chicken I was cooking as well.  I loved the crispy outer leaves.  This will be my go to recipe for brussel sprouts.

12/6/2010,5,Very tasty however I added bacon pieces with  shallots sauteed in bacon fat. Tossed with the sprouts and finally drizzled maple syrup over all.  A definite make again recipe.
12/5/2010,5,No changes needed! This was fantastic!

12/2/2010,5,Brussel sprout skeptic no more.  THIS was the hit at Thanksgiving this year.  I have ruined more brussel sprouts than insects in the past.  Thought that it was too simple to be so good.....so wr...

11/29/2010,5,This recipe is outstanding. The only thing my mom does to make it better is that she adds real bacon bits (she cooks the bacon and crushes it -- no jarred bacon bits). I'm sure she throws in som...

11/28/2010,5,Cut in half only had to cook for about 15 mins.

11/25/2010,5,The best Brussels sprouts I've ever had!  This was the first time I've ever made fresh sprouts.  I am so spoiled now! It will be hard for me to go back to frozen.  I only had to roast these for ...

11/23/2010,5,OMG - why have I not eaten brussel sprouts before?  These were wonderful! We halved all the sprouts after cutting off the ends and added butter and a little lemon for tang.  The charred sprout...

11/20/2010,5,Very good simple.  we make these all the time and the family never gets tired of them.  I think the kosher salt is a must - not table salt.  I will sometimes add a few slices of chopped bacon t...
11/19/2010,5,Never liked brussel sprouts until I tried this recipe.  I think 1 teaspoon salt is about right for the optimum taste. Roasting removes most of the bitter aftertaste and makes them softer.  Might...
11/18/2010,5,I never in my wildest dreams thought that I would ever love brussel sprouts! This recipe has changed how I look at the most disliked vegetable ever. The only ingredient I would add is granulate...
11/17/2010,5,I could not stop stealing these out of the dish while everything else finished cooking. I made two little changes. I use coconut oil instead of olive in most things as I did in this recipe and I...
11/16/2010,5,these are great! Mine were getting a little to black in the hot oven so I finished them off on the stove within a lidded pan. I like mine soft but not too black. Yummy.

11/9/2010,5,delicious! I'd never had brussel sprouts before. They seem to have a bad rep for being bitter. But these were anything but bitter. They were pleasantly mild and even sweet/creamy in flavor. I ma...

5/23/2010,5,I also find these addictive I could eat them every week. And if you melt 1/4 c. butter and squeeze a half lemon in it and pour on right before you serve they are even better! For less calories ...
5/11/2010,5,When I was a kid I hated brussels sprouts but I LOVED these!!  I made about 1/2 the recipe for the two of us.  I didn't use nearly as much oil maybe  1/2 T. and that was plenty.  Lots of cours...

3/15/2010,5,These are amazing! I cut them in 1/2 and added garlic as they roasted. Let me just say I really don't like brussel sprouts but only 1/4 of them made it to the table because I secretly ate the re...
3/14/2010,5,These are just wonderful... a bit of kosher salt and it really is a great side dish. You get crisp from the leaves and a lovely buttery taste from the centers.
3/14/2010,5,So good! I'll be making this all the time. I had no idea Brussels Sprouts could taste good.  I used more olive oil than the recipe calls for. I also added 2 cloves of garlic and probably should...

2/9/2009,5,I love roasted brussel sprouts!   The flavor is so great when they are roasted.  I cut a small X in the stems before roasting so they cook even.
2/8/2009,5,So easy and so delicious!
2/6/2009,5,These are SO good! I think they are better when they have cooled down a little rather than straight out of the oven. They are even good out of the refrigerator! I first tried this recipe two day...

2/6/2009,5,I was very skeptical of the long cooking time but these came out great! They really are great a little charred. I halved them and cooked for about 30 minutes. These are sooooo much better than ...
2/2/2009,5,These are awesome!  I used a bag of frozen brussels sprouts and boiled them on the stove for about 5 minutes.  I cut the fat by spraying the cookie sheet with cooking spray and then spraying aga...

1/30/2009,5,There is no way to make a mistake with this one! Instead of a bag I put the ingredients in a tupperware and shook it around.  I did 357 degrees instead of 400 degrees for 1/2 pound of brussel s...
1/30/2009,5,These were AMAZING!! I cut the sprouts in half before tossing in the bag. I was a little short on time so instead of oven roasting I decided to pan sear them and WOW I am so glad I did...OUT OF...
1/28/2009,5,This is the first time I have roasted anything or made brussel sprouts! These are delicious!!!!

1/27/2009,5,I absoltely love this recipe! I learned this about a year ago and ever since I have added my own twist. I add sliced onion and a few cloves of garlic to the brussel sprouts coat in olive oil ...

1/23/2009,5,loved it verry much verry tasty
1/23/2009,5,Pretty darn good.  I cook these in an electric skillet which allows the shell to get crispy while the insides are soft.  Delicious.
1/23/2009,5,Ok this recipe is great. Turned out better then I thought it would. I was not able to get fresh and had to use frozen was the only change I made. The outside just had a little crispness to it an...
1/23/2009,5,these are the best I have ever had. When boiled they tend to be bitter but roasting them really brings out the yummy flavors. Thank you for a great recipe.

1/19/2009,5,I love this recipe for sprouts. I sometimes mix it up a little by adding balsamic vinegar in with the oil. Excellent taste! Even the finicky eaters have their share. Also you can easily speed t...
1/18/2009,5,I followed the one review and boiled the sprouts 2 minutes prior to cooking. i added about a half teaspoon of minced galric and a splash of lemon juice. These are actually good hot and even bett...
1/17/2009,5,Our whole family enjoyed these!  When prepping save the little leaves that fall off and cook them with the rest.  That was our 5 year old's favorite part because they become crispy little 'chip...
1/17/2009,5,Excellent method for brussels sprouts.  I also have made green beans and asparagus using this hight-heat roasting technique and it adds sweetness to anything.  YUM!  I followed others' suggestio...

1/10/2009,5,Brussel sprouts now have a whole new flavor.  My new favorite way to prepare these little guys
1/9/2009,5,A very yummy option!  Loved them though I used a bit too much salt - would probably half that next time.
1/9/2009,5,Roasted veggies are always my favorite... Brussel Sprouts are no exception.  The only thing I would do differently is to slice each sprout in half.  I find the flavors are a bit more intense wit...
1/8/2009,5,My husband says that these were the best he has ever tasted!
1/7/2009,5,This recipe was AWESOME!  I only cooked 9 sprouts to try this so it only took about 20 minutes to cook.  After the first 20 minutes I turned off the heat and let them sit in the oven another 10...

1/5/2009,5,I love eating brussel sprouts this way.  As recommended by others I chopped my brussel sprouts in half before roasting with some roasted garlic-flavored olive oil.  I also checked on them every...
1/2/2009,5,I only gave this 5 stars because there wasn't a 10 star option!  I am addicted to these.  I make them at least twice a week.  One thing I do differently though.  I can't seem to find the small s...
12/28/2008,5,These taste SOOOO much better than boiled. love this method.

12/26/2008,5,Wonderful way to prepare brussel sprouts. I made them exactly as the recipe said and they came out perfect.
12/26/2008,5,These turned out great! Roasting veggies just gives them a fantastic flavor. I didn't have kosher salt on hand so I used the same measurements in sea salt & it turned out just fine. However I s...

12/19/2008,5,One of my favorite veggie dishes.  After I trim the ends I slice in half.  Just toss in olive oil pop in the oven and roast along with your main dish (meat).
12/17/2008,5,I made these last night for dinner. My husband (who dislikes brussels sprouts) even commented on how good they were. I loved them so much that I ate the leftovers straight out of the refrigerato...

11/24/2008,5,What a great way to make brussels sprouts! I also use this as a base and add pancetta and onions for a slightly different taste sometimes.
11/24/2008,5,I've been roasting my sprouts (and most every other veggie too!) for years and even those who say they hate brussels sprouts like them this way.  It's best in my opinion to cut them in half d...

11/1/2008,5,You all are SO right these sprouts are just delicious!  I did not precook them; recipe is perfect as written.  I would imagine that fresher sprouts will cook faster.
10/31/2008,5,This is basically Martha Stewart's recipe I have been making for years.  As it can take some time to get them carmelized in the oven I sometimes steam them first in the microwave in a little wa...

8/18/2008,5,WOW! Excellent recipe. I left the sprouts in for the whole 45 minutes and they turned out crunchy and soft on the inside. I used fresh ones and next time I will try with frozen and see how they ...

6/16/2008,5,These are AWESOME I'm having some tonight and can't wait.  They are almost buttery in taste and texture and the little burnt bits are so tasty.  I only wish brussels sprouts weren't so darn ex...

3/9/2006,5,These are the best brussel sprouts ever. Just reminds me that simple is usually best.  And a note-I was dubious about letting them get to dark but the darker they get the better they taste. Yum!
3/8/2006,5,I was never a big brussel sprout fan but these are awesome.  They weren't too too salty but you probably could cut the salt in half and still have them taste great.
3/8/2006,5,These are to DIE for!!!  I was a little worried about them tasting burnt but the taste is wonderful!!  I could eat these by themself as a meal!!
3/6/2006,5,Wow these were fabulous! The darker the better. Next time I'll use half the salt--they tasted fine but I think they'd still be great with less too.
3/5/2006,5,I just recently started eating brussel sprouts because hubby loves them and this is the second recipe I tried. The first one was pretty good but these are delicious! I served them along side st...
2/25/2006,5,I make this recipe often. Great taste!It is also healthy.
2/21/2006,5,This is the only way I make brussel sprouts. Sometimes if I am in a time crunch I put them under the broiler (just be careful to go sparingly on the olive oil) instead of in the oven. In the b...
2/20/2006,5,I had never tried Brussels Sprouts before and I'm quite confident this was the way to go.  These are so suprisingly good and it couldn't be easier to prepare.  They are salty and crispy on the...

2/5/2006,5,Awesome and easy! I wish my mom would of made them this way growing up! Thank you!!!
1/19/2006,5,I usually like plain steamed or boiled Brussels sprouts with salt but from now on this is the only way to eat Brussels sprouts! I didn't change a thing except my salt was Hawaiian sea salt in...
1/17/2006,5,Very simple recipe and it is a huge hit in my household!  I added some garlic powder and cooked them in my toaster oven.  YUMMY! Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!
1/16/2006,5,I've used both fresh and thawed brussel sprouts and both turn out equally good. They are an excellent side dish.  It's true that it's good even the next day.  The heavy 'browning' seems to take ...
1/16/2006,5,Delicious easy and cold leftovers are great.  Itoo added a little balsamic vinegar 5 minutes before removing from oven.  I also didn't let them get too blackened. Will definitely make these a...

1/6/2006,5,Made these for our Thanksgiving family potluck and they were delicious but did make a few changes combining them with another roasted brussel sprouts recipe I found in WW magazine. I added a c...
1/6/2006,5,Fantastic!! I am not a BS lover but my husband is so I am always looking for better ways to cook them. This was so great we have had it twice.

12/26/2005,5,Fabulous...fantastic....sprinkled with hot peppers the second time I made them......yum yum yum!    Thanks Jaqatac!!!!
12/25/2005,5,This is the best way to prepare brussel sprouts that I've found. I've tried many and this tops even the version by Christine L. Seriously yummy.
12/25/2005,5,Looking for a side dish that is concurrently easy and delicious?  Roasted Brussels Sprouts is the ticket.  Wow who knew that vegetables could taste so good.  After preparing this I can now pro...
12/21/2005,5,These were so delicious.  Brown and crispy on the outside yet soft and scrumptious on the inside.  I don't think I will eat brussels sprouts any other way after trying this recipe.
12/18/2005,5,These were great.  I have never been able to like brussel sprouts but I love these.  My small town grocery store didn't have fresh so I used frozen brussel sprouts.  They were still delicious.  ...

6/28/2016,5,Delightful taste will make this recipe again!
6/27/2016,5,My husband daughter & I loved this recipe. The only thing I didn't add was cayenne. My husband who does not particularly like cinnamon went back for more as did my daughter.  In fact it was ...

6/2/2016,5,Made it exactly as shown. Seriously great marinade. Basting with the extra marinade made an awesome glaze on the pork. I think it would also be amazing on chicken. Yumm!!!
5/31/2016,5,Did not baste as called for.  Did use reserve marinade as a sauce when chops were done.  Pretty darn good.
5/30/2016,5,I followed ingredients exactly but instead of grilling I browned chops in skillet and baked for 1 hr. Tasted great!
5/29/2016,5,so good!  I want to put this marinade on chicken wings and grill them.   only changes I made was I added orange juice and seasoned the meat w salt pepper and garlic powder before marinating. yu...

4/13/2016,5,My family really liked this. Really easy to whip up for a fast dinner

2/6/2016,5,I did make changes to this and it turned out great. I used your marinade it sounded delicious and it was. I had 3 to make so I adjusted the marinate proportionatly. I was running low on time so...
1/27/2016,5,I only had pork chops at hand and the recipe came out great. I did not put the ginger and the cinnamon due to the brown sugar already being sweet and the cayenne pepper giving the kick. Either w...
1/10/2016,5,No changes and will definitely make it again but will try it with pork ribs just to see how it goes.
1/1/2016,5,Very good! Sauce was enough for 3-4 boneless chops about 1 thick. Used fresh ginger and reduced cinnamon to about 1/8 tsp but all would have been ok. Marinaded overnight.
1/1/2016,5,great sauce! I love the tangy sweet taste it gave to the chops. Also it makes great looking grill marks on the chops!

11/15/2015,5,Turned out juicy and really good on my infrared grill.  Didnt really prepare the simmered sauce so I assume the chop can only get better. Would definitely recommend.
11/2/2015,5,Husband said these were the best grilled chops ever. 2nd time I made this I tripled the recipe to ensure we would have leftovers. Unexpected company stopped by and couldn't stop raving about ho...

6/17/2014,5,Very good.  Center cut pork loin. I made 3 1-1/2 chops.  A very nice sweet flavor.  Make sure you remove from grill when they hit 145 degrees. That is the key to very juicy chops.

10/24/2012,5,Let's get the hard part over first. The reduced sauce was too sweet and the cinnamon is too dominant. And that's AFTER I already cut it back to 1/8 of tsp. However the pork was delicious and wi...

3/23/2012,5,Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! This was incredibly delicious!!  I made it with white rice and asparagus and we dipped everything in the sauce!! I can't wait to make Pork Stir Fry and Fried Rice with...
3/21/2012,5,In a word...RIDICULOUS! I added a hint of ground cumin and served with an orange marmelade dipping sauce. WHOA!
3/8/2012,5,This was excellent.  I don't really care for ginger so I omitted and I didn't have any onion powder so I used 1/3 cup of chopped onion.  My husband and I just loved the flavor.
2/18/2012,5,Awesome! This marinade is so tasty and super simple to make. I will definitly be keeping this recipe on hand thanks!!!
2/2/2012,5,These pork chops were SO good!! I love the marinade!! I wasnt paying attention and missed the part where they needed to marinate for 4+ hours so I was only ended up being marinated for about an ...

11/12/2011,5,This marinade was really good; I didn't change a thing.  I did marinate over night as suggested and we made them on the grill.  Thanks for a great recipe!
11/9/2011,5,Amazing! And I took the suggestion of boiling the marinade from the bag and while it was heating up on the stove my husband kept coming in to see what smelled soooo good! Loved it! (used slightl...
9/19/2011,5,Delicious!  I marinated it over night.  and I ran out of Worcestershire sauce so I just made up the difference with Soy sauce. I doubled it for 6 pieces of pork and still had enough leftover for...
9/14/2011,5,This is a wonderful marinade to put on porl loin. It has a sweet tast and a hint of spicy. I would make this if I was going to have people over for dinner.It is best cooked on grill. over all it...

8/26/2011,5,These were absolutely delicious. I marinated for close to 5 hours and they were very flavorful. The glaze was a very nice touch too and gave my guests the ability to control how strong of a f...

8/21/2011,5,Very tender. Nice flavour
7/29/2011,5,My family loved the sweetness of this recipe.  I marinated in all of the sauce and then cooked up all the sauce on the stove.
7/25/2011,5,This recipe is GREAT! My family loved it! I just used less ginger (1/4 teaspoon) I highly recommend it best tasting pork chops ever!
7/18/2011,5,This was awesome i made 6 chops and served with rice pilaf cooked with spinach. I marinated some steak tips and fresh vegetables in it and grilled kabobs. Perfect
7/16/2011,5,This is the best recipe for Grilled Chops that I have ever tried.  Wow!  They are so moist and so full of flavor.  I marinated mine for about 4 hours.  I can't imagine what they would taste like...
7/14/2011,5,Made this as written and we really liked it!! Very easy and I always have the ingredients! Thanks for sharing!
7/7/2011,5,Wonderful recipe! I marinated overnight and grilled today the family gobbled it up with roasted new potatoes out of the garden. You just can't go wrong! I will make again and again...
7/4/2011,5,These were Excellent. My husband was mad I didn't make more. Next time I'll double for leftovers.
6/27/2011,5,Great marinade I have used it also on chicken but I think it is by far better on the pork.  The ingredients are readily available and i usually have it on hand.  I've done it without ketchup and...
6/25/2011,5,Results were great (even though I didn't have enough Worchestershire sauce as I did 7 times the recipe)! Everyone loved it. I did stir-fry vegetables as one of my side dishes and found that the ...
6/23/2011,5,I've always been afraid to put chops on the grill because I thought they would dry out. I made these and followed recipe as printed and they came out fantastic! The only thing I didn't do was re...
6/20/2011,5,i havent even cook the pork chops yet but this sauce is sooo good! i was leary about the ginger and cinamon so i only did a little dash of each. and i also didnt have soy sauce on hand so i used...
6/14/2011,5,This was absolutely fabulous!! I doubled the recipe ingredients and used baby back ribs. I marinated them in half the sauce (as mentioned) and then baked/basted them in the oven at 350. Wow - th...
6/6/2011,5,This was AWESOME!! My husband usually does not care for pork chops but states this is the best marinade ever!! States would be good on steak and shrimp too!! States this tastes like it was prepa...
6/6/2011,5,Wow!  This was good!  I doubled the ingredients for 5 chops.  I didn't have soy sauce so I substituted teriyaki in it's place.  Followed the rest of the recipe as stated.  Although I forgot to...
10/27/2017,4,No changes to the recipe .  They  turned out  beautiful.   Tender    moist and great flavor.  Family loved will make again
10/10/2017,4,Very good. A little to much ginger. But everyone enjoyed it. I poured some of the sauce over the top and garnished with fresh parsley. I also made fried potatoes and fried mushrooms bell pepper...
10/9/2017,4,We thought this was awesome. My kids and boyfriend rated it an 8 or 8.5.  My pork chops were thicker but I didn't want to over cook and the timing was great.  I doubled+ the recipe and marinaded...
9/28/2017,4,Really good flavorful pork recipe! I don't have a great grill so once the marinade crusted the outside (7 minutes on both sides of thick cuts) I cut the chops in half and turned the newly exp...
8/21/2017,4,I doubled the recipe but the garlic just overpowered the whole thing. I changed a few ingredients due to having no Worcester sauce in (added sriracha & more ketchup). I also reduced the cinnamon...
8/3/2017,4,AWESOME MARINADE! The only reason why I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it's a teensy bit salty. And I like salt. I also cooked it a little differently then grilling that I think makes i...
6/27/2017,4,Made this for dinner tonight. My kids usually complain about the seasoning choices i make for my chops but tonight no one said a word! The marinade is nice and sweet. Did not add any ginger (I p...
6/22/2017,4,These were very good.  I made exactly as directed except for the cayenne as I don't like that much heat.  The weather turned rainy when it was time to cook so I did them inside on a grill pan an...
6/16/2017,4,I confess I went a bit rogue with this one.  I didn't have time to marinate the chops so while they were grilling i mixed the marinade and reduced it to a thicker glaze to drizzle over the cho...
5/14/2017,4,Wow! these were great! I skipped the ginger and the onion powder. I didn't have any cayenne pepper so I added a pinch of cajun spice instead. I  let the chops sit in the marinade for about fift...
5/6/2017,4,I made this according to the recipe except eased up on the cinnamon and ginger as suggested by other reviewers.  I liked this OK didn't blow my socks off.  I doubled the recipe even though I on...
4/12/2017,4,Added extra garlic
4/11/2017,4,This was a nice marinade. I think I'll double it next time as I would have liked a little more to brush over the pork chops after cooking.
3/30/2017,4,I followed the recipe exactly and opted for the kebob option with a shorter marinate time.
3/10/2017,4,It was a nice change of pace. Because I like sauce I would double it next time. Also let the sauce sit for about 5 min and it will thicken on standing
2/24/2017,4,Not bad but a bit two sweet. Would probably use only 1/3 of the honey
2/15/2017,4,This was very tasty!  Based on other reviews I cut the ground ginger down to 1/8 tsp and i only had 1 T of Worcestershire sauce on hand so I added 2 T of water.  The marinade still had plenty of...
2/6/2017,4,Kids loved it. Seconds for all of them!
2/5/2017,4,I did it pretty much exactly as the menu called for except the grill is put away for the winter so browned a little in a fry pan with salt and pepper then added the ingredient and baked. Husband...
1/12/2017,4,I used fresh ginger since I had some on hand and I didn't get the ratio down right.  Ginger was way to overpowering.  Next time I will make this recipe as is because it was very good.  Or I wil...
12/6/2016,4,"Best. Marinade. Ever.

Seriously though i make this at least once a week. I will advise you to cut back on the ginger unless you really love it."
7/2/2016,4,THIS WAS GOOD BUT A LITTLE HEAVY WITH THE WORCHESTERSHIRE...I WILL MAKE AGAIN BUT WILL MODIFY.
6/1/2016,4,This was delicious and we barely had time to let it properly marinate.  Served with baked beans and grilled pineapple slices which made for a nice company meal in the summer.
5/5/2016,4,My family thought the pork chops were tender. However the flavors of honey and the ginger were not a hit with my family.
3/15/2016,4,I have made this a few times with no changes.  I loved this recipe and the glazed sauce is the coup d'grace at the end.  Thank you.  We really like it.
3/7/2016,4,Very good marinade  doubled recipe for extra chops.  Substituted smoked paprika for cayenne due to dietary constraints and omitted the cinnamon ( just not a fan of it on meat).  For grilling wo...
2/29/2016,4,Doubled the sauce except for the cinnamon.  Only had 30 minutes or so to marinade and forgot about the extra sauce for basting.  I boiled the extra as recipe states and we used it for dipping.  ...
2/16/2016,4,Awesome flavor and made my house smell amazing! I doubled the recipe...but should not have doubled the cayenne. Little hot for my taste buds which are fairly weak. My toddler approved so that's...
10/5/2015,4,My very picky husband loved this recipe. Next time I make it I think I'll reduce the cinnamon a little. Otherwise excellent marinade! Flavorful & made the pork very tender!
4/14/2015,4,Very good! My husband liked this more than I did and he truly enjoyed this recipe! I enjoyed my salad more! I will keep searching for a great grilled pork chop  marinade! If I did this one agai...
3/15/2015,4,As I do with most marinade recipes I didn't measure anything but just added what I thought was about the right amount (which is usually much more than what is called for). Still I would double...
1/25/2015,4,Enjoyed the flavors a lot except for a too-heavy ginger taste. We do a lot of marinades and a lot of pork chops and this one is being added to the rotation (sans the ginger!).
11/6/2014,4,Tasty savory sweet on the front chewy on the middle and a smooth finish. I would cook them until I was tired of eating them! I didn't have honey so I added an extra 1 tablespoon of brown sug...
11/6/2014,4,I used what I had on hand...sirloin chops. Mixed the marinade short of the ginger and (most of) the Worcestershire sauce that I did not have on hand. Added a good pinch of salt pepper and groun...
9/16/2014,4,Very tasty I enjoyed the touch of cinnamon it provided a flavor profile I'm not used to with a pork chop.
9/15/2014,4,These were very good. Next time I will leave out the cinnamon or just use less.  But very good overall.
5/4/2014,4,Excellent way to grill pork chops.  Everyone liked them and there was a bit of spice with the Worcestershire sauce.
4/30/2014,4,Very good went well with some roasted red potato's . I went by the recipe...Delicious!
3/9/2014,4,Thought they were great. Added raisins to the sauce.
1/28/2014,4,Used this with soy sauce & green onion cooking liquid from pork loin chops. Reduced what I had by half before cooking thinly sliced leftover pok loin chops made awesome sandwiches.
1/20/2014,4,This is actually a 4 1/2 star.  My husband gives it a 4 I say 5. He thought it was a little too sweet  I thought it was perfect!   So next time I'll reduce the sugar a tad bit.   Didn't change...
11/22/2013,4,I likes the sauce with the exception of the cinnamon otherwise pretty darn good!
10/28/2013,4,I ended up leaving in marinade for 1.5 days because planned meal got pushed back a day- was still good! Even my son who has never liked any pork chop recipe I've made liked it :)
9/30/2013,4,This was delicious! I modified it a little bit to make more spicy did teriyaki instead of worcestershire sauce and used thin cut pork chops and it turned out really good! My husband who isn't ...
5/23/2013,4,Really tasty. I used this on a tenderloin instead of chops because that's what I had and my husband loved it. I will be using this marinade again!
2/25/2013,4,Marinated for 4 hours and my family loved it. I can't wait to try it with a thinner chop marinated for even longer.... Delicious!
12/30/2012,4,Fantastic flavor - even if you don't measure the ingredients exactly.
10/14/2012,4,Great recipe!  I used mine for pork chops which I cooked ahead for sandwiches.  I ended up slicing the chops and dunking the slices into the left-over marinade before reheating.  Delicious!
8/15/2012,4,AWESOME! My picky eaters gobbled it up! The child who puts ketchup on everything by-passed the ketchup for the sauce! The meat was tender and juicy. I finally found a recipe for pork that makes ...
7/22/2012,4,Very delicious!  The only changes I made was half-ing the cinnamon (do not completely remove from ingredients it adds a nice change in flavor) and added a pinch more brown sugar.  I would recom...
7/3/2012,4,I followed the lead of several other reviewers and left out the cinnamon and ginger.  A little ginger might have been OK but I don't think it wanted cinnamon at all.  I added cumin instead.  It...
3/30/2012,4,We really enjoyed this recipe--will make it again!
3/22/2012,4,This is a great easy recipe. The only thing I wanted to mention is that as a professional chef i feel it my duty to let you know that it is considered safe by the fda to cook pork to an internal...
2/5/2012,4,It is a bit different but more tasty than you might think. We had it with pasta but mashed potatoes would have been better. I found the sauce more than what was needed (I did 4x the recipe for 9...
10/31/2011,4,I thought these were very good but you definitely need to grill them. I don't think the spices would work without the flavor that grilling it give them.
8/26/2011,4,4.5 Stars: I cut a 2.5 lb pork loin roast into slices and marinated for 2 days.  It was very good but be careful with the cinnamon.  We all agreed a touch more cinnamon would have ruined it.
7/26/2011,4,This was a good marinade but got mixed reviews at our house.
7/17/2011,4,These were tasty and my husband & daughter really liked them...however as written this is a 4 star in my book due to the ginger. The ginger amount really needs to be decreased unless you love g...
6/23/2011,4,These were a surprise wasn't sure about the cinnamon? Marinated over 24 hrs and they were very good. I had some left over though and decided to make a sandwich I did not care for that. The fla...
10/9/2017,3,Nice variation
9/30/2017,3,The glaze should be flagged as Asian Grilled Pork because that is the predominant flavor. I was expecting more American grilled so all my sides were off. Also didn't work much as a marinade e...
4/16/2016,3,the cinnamon was weird. it all got eaten but no one was super impressed. without cinnamon I would give it 4 stars.
3/6/2016,3,Please note the recipe says to discard the marinade but in the same step directs us to baste with the marinade and in the last step directs us to use the reserve marinade to make a sauce.
2/23/2016,3,This was a great start but I thought the sauce tasted too much like a bbq sauce. I added pineapple juice olive oil liquid smoke and fresh squeezed lime juice. With these additions it was fabu...
2/23/2016,3,These were OK but won't make again.
12/5/2015,3,This was okay but WAY too sweet! I already cut the brown sugar and honey by half.
3/23/2015,3,I personally was not impressed and found this incredibly sweet. but this is only my opinion
3/11/2015,3,This recipe was okay not too crazy about it. It needed salt which the recipe did not ask and since it has two salty sauces I thought it would not need it bu it did. We grilled it and though  I ...
8/11/2013,3,Well it was probably more of a grilling problem...the honey in the glaze is very flammable so I had charred chops the first time. Watch them closely! Second try was better!
7/5/2012,3,the chops were very tender. I used half the honey and half the broen sugar. I would not havee liked any more sweetness. In fact I think I will try this again with no brown sugar and half the hon...
6/19/2011,3,Not bad not great.  Not that crazy about the spice taste.  I like the concept and will try it again without the ginger and the cinnamon.
8/30/2017,2,Not much flavor
5/12/2015,2,Too sweet and odd combo of flavors made it a not favorite marinade.
5/4/2015,2,OK but not my favorite.
11/5/2014,2,Way too much Worcestershire sauce the marinade was thin and the family did not like it. I would adjust: 3 Tablespoons of Ketchup and 2 Teaspoons of Worcestershire instead of the other way aroun...
9/12/2014,2,Not a keeper Sorry just a bad combination  wife didnt like it either
9/29/2013,2,I made the pork chops tonight and the meat did 't have any flavor. Will not cook this again.
11/12/2017,1,I love most Chinese sauces but this one is a no.  Too much cinnamon and that's all you can taste.
10/7/2011,1,These chops were very tender but I thought that the marinade gave them a terrible flavor.  It must have been the seasonings that I did not like as the liquid ingredients are quite common in mos...

1/12/2015,5,This was a really tasty recipe.  Took a few ideas from Mr. Chuck Sampson (who must be an amazing cook) and it turned out perfect.  A definite keeper!
1/11/2015,5,Very easy to follow! Didn't think it would turn out so tasty with the few herbs used. I cut down to 3 1/2 beef cubes (I started with 2 cubes and just added more until I got the taste I wanted) a...
1/10/2015,5,the best thing for winter
1/8/2015,5,"Delicious. I went for a second helping! I never do that. 
Super salty though. Next time I'll use a low sodium broth.
I followed Chuck Sampson's suggestion on the flour  garlic and onion powder ..."
12/21/2014,5,Such an easy stew to make and great flavor I changed a few things though just because they're old habits:
12/20/2014,5,Made this and it was so good and my husband loved it he gave me a high five
12/13/2014,5,Excellent taste! Thank you for the recipe.

11/30/2014,5,Really good. I was craving beef stew but didn't have time for the crock pot.  I think this is better anyway. I made changes Chuck suggested but didn't have wine so used some beer instead. Also u...
11/23/2014,5,Absolutely delicious. Very tasty and the beef was incredibly tender. The family really likes it. Will definitely do again.
11/23/2014,5,Amazing stew. Use a Pino Noir and a little more pepper as my family loves pepper. Served with biscuits. This was so easy!
11/23/2014,5,We loved it!  Added the red wine as well as flavored the meat before browning.  Used fresh rosemary.  Wonderful recipe thank you!
11/22/2014,5,Browning the meat didn't make it softer -- follow the recipe as is and you'll have a great stew.
11/22/2014,5,We followed this recipe exactly and it was very good. The only thing I added was a couple of splashes of worcestershire sauce.
11/19/2014,5,Excellent stew!!  The whole family loved it.

11/9/2014,5,Drenched the stewing beef in flour pepper salt before cooking. Then sautéed onions. Little less Rosemary. Wonderful with fresh bread.
11/9/2014,5,We loved this beef stew creation. We made a few adjustments. We used 2lbs of flank steak (marinated in wine for about an hour) seared on a grill pan before we added it to the large pot with the...

3/22/2006,5,"Big hit in our house! This is the only way I make stew now.  The only variation that we make is that we leave out celery (just because of our tastes) and we add corn. 
Great recipie!"
3/3/2006,5,"Used vension which can be a little tougher so I cooked it for 2 hours before adding the vegetables.  Followed the recipe exactly.  Very good basic stew.  Will make again.
Thanks"
2/22/2006,5,Wow this was delicious! It had so much flavor and the meat was very tender. After cooking the meat for an hour I let it sit (with the stove off) for almost another hour. I also added 1 package ...
2/15/2006,5,Excellent flavor!  I added corn.
2/12/2006,5,I made this for the first time today and based on some previous reviewers suggestions I browned the beef coated with flour pepper and garlic. Then I added 1 cup red wine and 3 cups water and ...

2/1/2006,5,This was a very good beef stew it's not bitter like the recipe that I used before. Just fabulous.
1/23/2006,5,This recipe will be replacing my old recipe from now on. Awesome blend of spices. I did roll the meat in flour before browing with a pinch of each of the seasoning the recipe called for so I did...
1/15/2006,5,This was really easy to make for rather inexperienced cooks.  I added more cornstarch and water to make a thicker gravy.  Delicious!!!  Thank you!
1/13/2006,5,"Wow! I'm still an intermediate level cook but this recipe made me feel like an expert.

I read the other reviews and used the beef broth instead of water. I also added a cup of red wine.

1/7/2006,5,OMG!  This smelled awesome while it was cooking.  My only complaint was that I prefer a thicker stew and even with the cornstarch it wasn't quite as thick as I would have liked.  The taste howev...
1/3/2006,5,perfection
12/31/2005,5,"While eating this for lunch today my husband told me it is the best stew he has ever had. Can't do better than that!
I did modify slightly by using only one potato and adding corn and peas. This..."
12/30/2005,5,I lurved this stew! I think next time I'll use roast beef instead of stew meat just because I prefer the texture of roast but it was a wonderfully savory and tender stew.
12/28/2005,5,The best stew recipe yet!  I did make some changes from the reviews.  First I sprinkled garlic powder and pepper on the meat then sprinkled with flour then I browned the meat.  I substituted 1c ...

12/25/2005,5,Delicious!  Thanks for the great recipe.
12/20/2005,5,My husband loved this stew... so did I. I added the potatos sooner then it said to to make sure they where cooked all the way through and next time I will add more potato. I also added corn at...
12/19/2005,5,Awesome!!! I followed some great suggestions to tweak this recipe (not that I thought it needed it because it was my first time making it...) Instead of boullion cubes I used 2 cans of beef br...

12/11/2005,5,Absolutely delicious.  The best stew recipe that I have ever made.  I added a couple handfulls of peas because my son loves them.  I will definitely make this again.
12/7/2005,5,This is a great stew especially if you don't have a lot of time.  I added about a half a bag of frozen mixed vegetables at the last 20 minutes or so.  I'll be making this again for sure!
12/4/2005,5,This is an awesome recipe!! I added a bit more cornstarch to make it thicker and it was a big hit with the family. I will be saving this recipe!
12/3/2005,5,This is a great recipe because it's easy to customize and easy to prepare. Tweak it the way you like it and you won't be disappointed. For instance I left out the rosemary parsley and celer...

11/19/2005,5,This stew is incredibly tasty. I used what I had on hand. Instead of bouillon cubes I added 4 cups of real beef stock to begin and also added one breast of chicken to the meat. I had no parsley...

11/8/2005,5,Very tasty very easy! I used three tablespoons of constarch because of family prefers stews/soups thicker than most. i will make this again.
11/6/2005,5,Love this recipe.  I was surprised at how favorful the beef was even after all that simmering.  I used a little more corn starch/water just because the family likes a thick gravy but it was gre...
11/4/2005,5,Excellent recipe but I found one hour was not long enough for the vegetables to cook. They were still a little crunchy. Next time I put the vegetables in with the meat and it was perfect.
10/30/2005,5,This is a great recipe for cold days ahead.  I had guests over and there was none left by the time dinner was over.  Everyone thought it was excellent.

10/10/2005,5,Great simple recipe...just a beef stew should be.  Straight forward and meaty.  The only variation was the amount of cornstarch...totalled around 8 teaspoons in my version.
10/8/2005,5,I've forgotten how good stew could be until I found this recipe.  Excellent flavour.  I did need to use more cornstarch than what was called for.
10/4/2005,5,A fantastic stew. I did add more corn starch for thickness but other than that kept it the same. I will make this agian.
9/29/2005,5,This was delicious. I used some steaks from my freezer that I had purchased on sale a couple weeks ago and the meat was super tender while the veggies were just a little crisp and not mushy. I l...

9/3/2005,5,Very easy to make and very tasty! I served it alone without rice and it did great. Can't wait to try it with lamb as Irish stew.
9/2/2005,5,I made this wonderful stew and served it in a bowl of acorn squash.   I cooked the squash in the oven first then ladeled the stew in.  It adds a sweetness to the stew and was an edible bowl.
8/8/2005,5,This is the first time I've made stew. I usually don't like stew but I thought this recipe was pretty savoury. I did add a can of stewed tomatoes added some paprika browned the beef with garl...
8/4/2005,5,We overcooked this by 40 minutes and it was still sooooo good! I think the trick is to barely simmer it.
7/26/2005,5,This recipe was awesome!  I'm not a very experienced cook and usually have to mess a recipe up at least once before I get it right.  Not this one though.  It tasted great and was so much easie...
7/25/2005,5,WOW - Really good.  Yes I tampered with it.  Added some red wine and garlic.  It stands on its own so no noodles or rice are needed.  I cut the beef into no larger than 3/4 to an inch pieces.  ...
7/19/2005,5,Excellent!  I only got to taste it while I was cooking it once served they ate it all up before I could even get to it.  I am making it again tonight and doubling the recipe! Thanks so much for...
7/5/2005,5,My quest for the 'right' beef stew probably ends here. I had a certain taste in mind that definitely excluded tomatoes plus I wanted it to be just a little sweet. I followed the recipe and  add...

4/15/2005,5,Excellent and easy to make.  I suggest making sure the meat is in smaller chunks so that it will cook in time.  I had larger cuts and it took 2 hours and 45 minutes to become tender.  Also I ad...

3/22/2005,5,I have to say that in my 30+ years of cooking I have never tasted a stew quite like this one.  I did not use the Bouillon cubes as it called for as they tend to be to salty.  I go for a less exp...

1/31/2005,5,Excellent recipe wouldn't change a thing.  May have to tinker with the water/cornstarch ratio depending on what heat you have it on.
1/31/2005,5,This was just perfect!!  The rosemary was an unexpected surprise albeit a delicious one.  The only thing I did different from the recipe was to coat the meat with flour and garlic powder which I...

2/20/2003,5,This stew was wonderful.  Although it took at long time to cook it was worth the wait.  I made it the Italian Bread Bowl recipe I also got from this site.  Thanks Paula!

12/3/2002,5,It's pretty good.  I recommend using stewing meat with a bit more fat... It's a bit more tender.  Lean pieces of meat comes out a bit dry.
